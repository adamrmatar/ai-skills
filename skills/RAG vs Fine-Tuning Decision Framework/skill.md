# RAG vs Fine-Tuning Decision Framework

## Overview

When building generative AI systems, one of the most critical decisions is whether to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. Both approaches have distinct advantages and are suited for different types of problems. This skill will guide you through the decision-making process, helping you choose the right approach based on your specific needs.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify the Problem**: Determine whether your problem involves factual, changing, or private information (best for RAG) or patterns, tone, and behavior (best for fine-tuning).
2. **Evaluate Data Requirements**: Assess if the data is static or frequently updated. RAG is more flexible for frequently changing data.
3. **Consider Implementation Speed**: RAG is faster to implement and safer for production environments.
4. **Assess Consistency Needs**: Fine-tuning is necessary when you need consistent behavior that retrieval and prompts cannot guarantee.
5. **Combine Approaches if Necessary**: Many production systems benefit from using both RAG and fine-tuning. For example, use RAG for retrieving company policies and fine-tuning to ensure responses follow company guidelines.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice**: Start with RAG for most scenarios due to its flexibility and ease of implementation.
- **Common Pitfall**: Choosing fine-tuning too early when the real issue is poor retrieval or unclear requirements.

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Test Retrieval Accuracy**: Ensure the RAG system retrieves the most relevant documents.
2. **Evaluate Response Consistency**: Check if fine-tuned models consistently follow the desired tone and structure.
3. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor the system's performance in production to identify any issues.
