# Agent Maintenance and Optimization Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches you to maintain and optimize AI agents by focusing on their "harness" - the controlled environment that governs their capabilities and constraints. Based on real-world examples like Vercel's agent optimization, you'll learn to:

- Systematically prune unnecessary tools ([Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md))
- Adapt the harness to model improvements
- Keep the agent aligned with evolving workflows
- Implement rigorous validation processes

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Document Current State**
   - Inventory all tools, permissions, and data sources
   - Record baseline performance metrics
   - Map current workflow touchpoints

2. **Conduct Five Critical Checks** ([Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md))
   1. Source validity
   2. Permission appropriateness
   3. Job scope alignment
   4. Proof requirements
   5. Business value

3. **Implement Pruning**
   - Use the [decision framework](references/code_examples.md) to evaluate each tool
   - Remove non-essential elements in batches
   - Monitor impact for 1-2 weeks

4. **Update Harness Configuration**
   - Adjust permissions based on model capabilities
   - Refresh stale data sources
   - Modify proof requirements as needed

5. **Establish Maintenance Rhythm**
   - Weekly quick checks
   - Monthly deep reviews
   - Quarterly redesign sessions
   - Immediate updates after model changes

## Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with minimal tools and add cautiously
- **Prove Value**: Every tool should justify its maintenance overhead
- **Document Changes**: Maintain a [change log](references/code_examples.md) for all harness modifications
- **Human Oversight**: Keep review steps even as the model improves

## Common Pitfalls

- **Tool Accumulation**: Adding features without removing obsolete ones
- **Stale Constraints**: Keeping limitations designed for weaker models
- **Silent Drift**: Allowing the agent's role to change without explicit approval
- **Overautomation**: Removing human checks prematurely

## Validation Steps

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify core functionality after each change
   - Check error rates on key tasks

2. **Value Assessment**
   - Measure time saved versus maintenance cost
   - Survey end-users on output quality

3. **Stress Testing**
   - Evaluate performance on edge cases
   - Verify fail-safes trigger appropriately

4. **Model Impact Analysis**
   - Assess how model updates affect existing constraints
   - Test whether old protections now limit potential

## Implementation Notes

- Use the [configuration template](references/code_examples.md) to standardize harness setups
- Schedule pruning sessions quarterly at minimum
- Treat the harness as a living system, not a one-time setup
- Balance model capabilities with business risk tolerance
