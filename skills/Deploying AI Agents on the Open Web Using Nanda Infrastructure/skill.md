### Overview
Deploying AI agents on the open web requires a robust infrastructure for discovery, commerce, and coordination. Nanda provides this infrastructure through its index, registries, and protocols. This skill will guide you through the process of deploying your AI agent using Nanda's open infrastructure.

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define Your Agent**: Start by defining your agent's capabilities and goals. Use the `Open Claw` framework to build your agent loop.
2. **Register Your Agent**: Fill out the agent facts form on `host39.org` to get an agent card and publish it to the Nanda index.
3. **Host Your Agent**: Decide whether to run your agent locally or on the cloud. Use platforms like Maritime for cost-effective hosting.
4. **Test Your Agent**: Use Nanda Town to simulate and test your agent's interactions with other agents.
5. **Monitor and Optimize**: Continuously monitor your agent's performance and optimize its interactions based on real-world data.

### Code Snippets
```python
# Example of defining an agent using Open Claw
from openclaw import Agent

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.tools = ['tool1', 'tool2']

    def execute_task(self, task):
        # Implement task execution logic here
        pass
```

### Best Practices
- **Self-Hosting**: Use open-source, self-hosted agents to maintain control over your agent's operations.
- **Adaptive Resolution**: Leverage the Nanda index's adaptive resolution to route traffic efficiently.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Overlooking Costs**: Hosting multiple agents can become expensive. Use platforms like Maritime to manage costs.
- **Ignoring Testing**: Failing to test your agent in a simulated environment can lead to unexpected issues in production.

### Validation and Testing
- **Simulation**: Use Nanda Town to simulate agent interactions and identify potential issues.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor key performance metrics to ensure your agent is functioning as expected.
