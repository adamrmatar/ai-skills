### Overview
Recursive Language Models (RLM) are designed to handle large codebases by externalizing context management into a programmable execution environment. This approach allows you to curate relevant code chunks and use recursive queries to enhance understanding and reasoning over structured code data. For a deeper dive into the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Create a separate, dedicated environment for the model to operate on the codebase.
2. **Curate Context**: Write code to inspect, slice, and compute relevant chunks of the codebase.
3. **Feed Context**: Feed the curated context into the main context window of the model.
4. **Recursive Queries**: Use recursive queries to ask another language model or system for additional information if needed.
5. **Terminate Loop**: Continue the loop until a final result is achieved.

### Code Snippets
```python
# Example of curating context
import os

def curate_context(codebase_path):
    relevant_chunks = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(codebase_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                    if 'relevant_keyword' in content:
                        relevant_chunks.append(content)
    return relevant_chunks
```

### Best Practices
- **Externalize Context Management**: Always externalize context management to avoid overwhelming the model's main context window.
- **Use Recursive Queries**: Utilize recursive queries to gather additional information when the initial context is insufficient.
- **Monitor Token Usage**: Keep an eye on token usage to manage costs and performance effectively.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Overloading Context**: Avoid overloading the model's context window with irrelevant information.
- **Ignoring Structure**: Do not ignore the structured nature of codebases; leverage directories, imports, and dependencies.

### Validation and Testing
- **Run Test Cases**: Execute test cases to ensure the curated context is relevant and the recursive queries return accurate information.
- **Check Traces**: Review traces in JSONL format to validate the RLM loop and final output.
