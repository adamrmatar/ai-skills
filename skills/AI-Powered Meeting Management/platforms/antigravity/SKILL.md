# AI-Powered Meeting Management Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to manage meetings end-to-end using AI assistance, transforming meeting productivity. The system operates across three phases: [Preparation](references/core_concepts.md), Execution, and Follow-up. Key capabilities include agenda generation, real-time debate support, and automated follow-through.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Pre-Meeting Preparation**
   - Analyze calendar events 24 hours in advance
   - Generate suggested agenda using [template](references/code_examples.md)
   - Surface relevant historical context from past meetings
   - Allow human review and modification before distribution

2. **During Meeting Execution**
   - Provide real-time transcription and note-taking
   - Activate debate assistant when needed (see [API example](references/code_examples.md))
   - Suggest follow-up questions based on discussion flow
   - Track action items and decisions automatically

3. **Post-Meeting Follow-up**
   - Generate follow-up communications using templates
   - Update connected systems (CRM, task managers)
   - Create knowledge base articles from key insights
   - Share relevant clips with stakeholders

## Best Practices
- Always review AI-generated agendas for relevance
- Use debate assistant sparingly to avoid derailing discussions
- Customize follow-up templates for different meeting types ([Guide](references/practical_guide.md))
- Regularly audit automated system updates for accuracy

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-reliance on AI suggestions without human judgment
- Failing to properly configure participant privacy settings
- Not reviewing automatically generated action items for clarity
- Skipping the human review step for sensitive communications

## Validation Steps
1. Test agenda generation with historical meetings and compare to actual outcomes
2. Verify debate assistant suggestions with subject matter experts
3. Audit automated follow-ups for 5% of meetings to ensure quality
4. Measure time savings in meeting preparation and follow-up
