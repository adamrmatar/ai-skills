name: Processing Unstructured Physical Data with AI Agents
description: >-
  This skill enables AI agents to efficiently process and analyze unstructured physical data (e.g., video recordings, sensor data, robot telemetry) using data harnesses, Pydantic schemas, and execution engines. It covers data modeling, distributed computing, and incremental updates to handle large-scale, complex datasets.

## Overview
Processing unstructured physical data (e.g., video recordings, sensor data) is a complex task due to the sheer volume and complexity of the data. This skill teaches you how to build a **data harness** that enables AI agents to efficiently process, analyze, and query such data. Key components include **Pydantic schemas** for data modeling, **execution engines** for distributed computing, and **incremental updates** to avoid redundant processing.

For a deeper dive into the core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Install the Required Tools**: Install the necessary libraries and tools, such as Pydantic and DataChain.
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic datachain
   ```
2. **Define Pydantic Schemas**: Create schemas to model your unstructured data. This ensures consistency and enables efficient querying.
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class VideoFrame(BaseModel):
       file_path: str
       frame_id: int
       timestamp: float
       class_id: int
       confidence_score: float
       bounding_box: dict
   ```
3. **Set Up the Execution Engine**: Configure a distributed computing engine (e.g., Dask) to process data in parallel.
   ```python
   from dask import distributed

   client = distributed.Client()
   ```
4. **Process Data Incrementally**: Use incremental updates to avoid reprocessing data that has already been analyzed.
   ```python
   def process_file(file_path):
       # Process the file and return results
       return VideoFrame(file_path=file_path, frame_id=1, timestamp=0.0, class_id=1, confidence_score=0.9, bounding_box={})

   results = client.map(process_file, file_paths)
   ```
5. **Query the Database**: Use SQL-like queries to retrieve insights from the processed data.
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM video_frames WHERE class_id = 1;
   ```
6. **Validate and Test**: Run tests to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of your data processing pipeline.
   ```python
   def test_video_frame():
       frame = VideoFrame(file_path='video.mp4', frame_id=1, timestamp=0.0, class_id=1, confidence_score=0.9, bounding_box={})
       assert frame.class_id == 1
   ```

## Best Practices
- **Use Pydantic Schemas**: Pydantic ensures data consistency and simplifies schema management. Avoid using JSON files or SQL databases directly.
- **Leverage Distributed Computing**: Use execution engines like Dask to process large datasets efficiently.
- **Implement Incremental Updates**: Avoid redundant processing by using incremental updates and checkpoints.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Data Modeling**: Skipping schema definition leads to inconsistent data and inefficient queries.
- **Overlooking Distributed Computing**: Processing large datasets sequentially is slow and resource-intensive.
- **Failing to Validate**: Without proper testing, errors in data processing can go unnoticed.

For a practical guide on avoiding these pitfalls, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Validation Steps
1. **Schema Validation**: Ensure all data adheres to the defined Pydantic schemas.
2. **Query Accuracy**: Verify that SQL queries return accurate results.
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure the efficiency of the distributed computing engine.
4. **Incremental Update Testing**: Confirm that incremental updates work as expected.
