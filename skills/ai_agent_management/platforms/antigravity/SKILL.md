  Comprehensive skill for managing AI agents using control planes, observability, and optimization techniques.

## Overview
Managing AI agents effectively requires a structured approach to ensure governance, safety, trust, and observability. This skill focuses on leveraging control planes, observability frameworks, and optimization techniques to manage AI agents in production environments. For a deeper understanding of core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Identify and Catalog Agents**: Begin by identifying all AI agents within your organization. Catalog them based on their functions, dependencies, and operational environments.
2. **Implement Control Plane**: Set up a control plane similar to Kubernetes to manage agent identity, policy enforcement, observability, and lifecycle. Detailed steps can be found in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
3. **Enable Observability**: Integrate observability frameworks like OpenTelemetry to monitor agent activities and gather telemetry data.
4. **Evaluate and Optimize**: Use evaluation harnesses to assess agent performance. Optimize agents based on evaluation results to improve efficiency and reliability.
5. **Enforce Policies**: Implement policy enforcement mechanisms to ensure agents adhere to organizational guidelines and regulatory requirements.
6. **Monitor Costs**: Continuously monitor and optimize the costs associated with running AI agents.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Setting up observability with OpenTelemetry
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(ConsoleSpanExporter())

# Example: Prompt template for agent evaluation
prompt_template = "Evaluate the performance of agent {agent_name} based on {criteria}."
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Regularly update and refine evaluation harnesses to adapt to changing agent behaviors.
- **Common Pitfall**: Neglecting to enforce policies can lead to agents operating outside of organizational guidelines.

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. **Unit Testing**: Conduct unit tests to verify individual agent functionalities.
2. **Integration Testing**: Perform integration tests to ensure agents work seamlessly within the broader system.
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate agent performance under various conditions to identify bottlenecks.
