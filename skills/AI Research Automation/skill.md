# AI Research Automation Skill

## Overview

This skill enables AI agents to autonomously conduct machine learning research by:
1. Analyzing research papers and community contributions ([Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md))
2. Designing and running optimized experiments ([Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md))
3. Implementing solutions within competition constraints
4. Validating and submitting high-quality results

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Scrape recent papers from arXiv/Conferences
   - Monitor community forums and GitHub repositories
   - Extract key techniques and implementations

2. **Idea Synthesis**
   - Combine promising approaches from different sources
   - Identify abandoned ideas worth revisiting
   - Generate novel combinations (see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md) for implementation)

3. **Experiment Design**
   - Set up parameter search spaces
   - Configure resource constraints (GPU, memory, time)
   - Implement early stopping criteria

4. **Constraint Management**
   - Monitor model size/compute usage
   - Apply quantization/pruning as needed
   - Verify all competition rules are followed

5. **Quality Validation**
   - Run statistical significance tests
   - Check for overfitting
   - Verify implementation correctness
   - Ensure novelty (not duplicate work)

6. **Submission & Tracking**
   - Format submission per competition requirements
   - Track which ideas get adopted by others (H-index)
   - Log compute/resource usage metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Focus on execution quality** over quantity - Aiden's 28% acceptance rate vs community 5%
2. **Leverage human creativity** by implementing abandoned ideas
3. **Maintain strict quality gates** - only 47 of 2000 submissions passed review in Parameter Golf
4. **Optimize compute usage** - Aiden produced 15% of records with just 4% of total compute

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Data leakage**: As seen in the fraud detection example, loose APIs can cause test set contamination
2. **Over-optimization**: Chasing local maxima on the competition metric without real improvements
3. **Resource waste**: Brute-force parallelization without smart prioritization
4. **Isolation**: Not incorporating community ideas and feedback

## Validation Steps

1. **Statistical testing**: Ensure improvements are significant (p < 0.05)
2. **Overfitting checks**: Train/validation gap should be reasonable (<15% difference)
3. **Constraint verification**: Confirm model meets all competition requirements
4. **Impact measurement**: Track how often others build on your submissions (H-index)

## Implementation Notes

- Start with the experiment template from [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)
- Use the quality gate implementation to filter submissions
- Constraint handlers should be competition-specific
- Monitor both performance metrics and community impact
