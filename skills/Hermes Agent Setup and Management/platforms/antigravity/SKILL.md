name: Hermes Agent Setup and Management
description: >-
  A comprehensive skill for setting up and managing Hermes Agent, an open-source AI assistant, including installation, configuration, skill development, and automation.
---

### Overview
Hermes Agent is a powerful, open-source AI assistant that grows with you through a self-improving loop of skills and automations. It runs on your own infrastructure and can be managed through various platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Slack. This skill will guide you through setting up Hermes Agent, configuring its core functionalities, and leveraging its capabilities for automation and skill development.

### Core Concepts
Hermes Agent operates on five main pillars: Memory, Skills, Soul, Cron, and Self-Improving Loop. These pillars enable Hermes to carry context across sessions, execute reusable tasks, shape its personality, schedule automations, and improve over time. For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up VPS**: Choose a virtual private server (VPS) provider like Hostinger and deploy Hermes Agent. For detailed instructions, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
2. **Install Hermes Agent**: Use the one-click Docker installation method for simplicity. Alternatively, install directly on the VPS root.
3. **Configure Hermes Agent**: Set up inference providers, messaging channels, and API keys. Use the following command to set an API key securely:
```bash
HERMES_CONFIG_SET GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
```
4. **Develop Skills**: Create reusable playbooks for tasks. Example skill template:
```yaml
---
name: Generate Image
description: Generates an image based on a description.
steps:
  - description: Describe the image
    command: generate_image --description "{{ description }}"
---
```
5. **Set Up Cron Jobs**: Schedule automations using natural language commands. Example:
```bash
hermes cron create --name "Daily AI News Briefing" --time "06:00" --command "generate_news_briefing"
```
6. **Connect to GitHub**: Sync your Hermes Agent with a GitHub repo for backup and version control.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use Docker containers for easy management.
  - Secure API keys by storing them in `.env` files.
  - Regularly back up your Hermes Agent to GitHub.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Avoid storing secrets in conversation history.
  - Ensure proper permissions for GitHub tokens to avoid creation failures.

### Validation and Testing
1. **Test Connection**: Verify Hermes Agent responds to basic commands.
2. **Check Cron Jobs**: Ensure scheduled tasks execute as expected.
3. **Validate GitHub Sync**: Confirm that changes are pushed to the GitHub repo.
