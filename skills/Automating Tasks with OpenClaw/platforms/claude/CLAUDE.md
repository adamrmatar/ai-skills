# Automating Tasks with OpenClaw

## Overview
OpenClaw is a powerful AI tool that acts as a digital employee, automating tasks like email responses, meeting scheduling, and tool integrations. Unlike chatbots, OpenClaw performs end-to-end tasks autonomously. This skill teaches you how to set up OpenClaw on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), configure integrations, and automate workflows.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up OpenClaw on VPS**: Use a VPS for easier setup and cost efficiency. Follow the steps in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) to configure OpenClaw.
2. **Configure Telegram Integration**: Set up Telegram to interact with OpenClaw. Use the BotFather to create a bot and link it to OpenClaw.
3. **Connect Gmail and Google Drive**: Enable two-factor authentication and create app passwords for Gmail. Follow the detailed steps in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) to integrate Google Drive.
4. **Automate Sponsorship Emails**: Use OpenClaw to read, filter, and respond to sponsorship emails. Attach media kits from Google Drive automatically.
5. **Schedule Meetings**: Integrate Google Calendar to allow OpenClaw to schedule meetings autonomously.

## Code/Prompt Templates
```plaintext
# Example prompt for automating sponsorship emails
"Read the emails today for sponsorship offers from EdTech company, decline for any other offer, send them a media kit."

# Example prompt for scheduling meetings
"Schedule a meeting with Karandeep tomorrow for a discussion on Boston project. Pick any 30-minute time between 9:00 to 12:00 noon."
```

## Best Practices
- **Use VPS**: Avoid local setup complexities by using a VPS. It’s cost-effective and easier to manage.
- **Detailed Prompts**: Provide clear and detailed instructions to OpenClaw to ensure accurate task execution.
- **Regular Testing**: Test integrations and workflows regularly to ensure they function as expected.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Incomplete Setup**: Missing steps in Gmail or Google Drive integration can cause failures. Double-check each step.
- **Ambiguous Prompts**: Vague instructions can lead to incorrect task execution. Be specific in your prompts.

## Validation Steps
1. **Test Telegram Integration**: Send a message to your Telegram bot and verify OpenClaw responds correctly.
2. **Check Email Automation**: Send a test sponsorship email and confirm OpenClaw responds appropriately.
3. **Verify Meeting Scheduling**: Schedule a test meeting and confirm it appears in your Google Calendar.
