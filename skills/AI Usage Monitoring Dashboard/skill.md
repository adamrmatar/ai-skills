# AI Usage Monitoring Dashboard Skill

## Overview
Build a dashboard to track and analyze your AI token usage across different models. This helps you:
- Understand your AI usage patterns
- Identify productivity opportunities
- Compare model effectiveness
- Optimize delegated intelligence

Learn core concepts in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Set Up Data Collection**
   - For Codex: Use API usage endpoints
   - For Claude/ChatGPT: Implement log parsing or estimation (see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md))

2. **Design Your Dashboard**
   - Choose key metrics (daily tokens, model split, task types)
   - Select visualization style (Tufte-style recommended)
   - Determine time scale (daily + weekly views)

3. **Build Initial Version**
   - Use provided [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)
   - Start with basic token counts
   - Add model differentiation

4. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Top 10 usage days analysis
   - Same-day activity correlation
   - Token efficiency metrics

5. **Deploy and Iterate**
   - Set up daily auto-refresh
   - Review weekly for insights
   - Continuously add dimensions

## Best Practices

1. **Make It Personal**
   - Track activities you actually do
   - Note what worked/didn't each day

2. **Focus on Growth**
   - Use dashboard to identify underused capabilities
   - Challenge yourself to increase effective token usage

3. **Share Learnings**
   - Contribute insights to community
   - Learn from others' dashboards

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vanity Metrics**
   - Don't just track total tokens - focus on what they achieved
   - Example: 800M tokens/day only matters if it created value

2. **Model Myopia**
   - Don't compare models without context
   - Example: Claude may use more tokens but produce better results

3. **Data Overload**
   - Start simple, then expand
   - Example: Begin with just Codex before adding other models

## Validation

1. **Sanity Check Estimates**
   - Compare manual calculations to dashboard
   - Spot check high-usage days

2. **Test Insights**
   - Implement one dashboard-inspired change weekly
   - Measure impact on productivity

3. **Peer Review**
   - Share dashboard with colleagues
   - Incorporate feedback

## Continuous Improvement

1. Weekly review sessions
2. Monthly feature additions
3. Quarterly complete redesigns to match evolving usage
