# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Ai Phone Agent Deployment
> Deploy an AI phone agent to handle customer inquiries efficiently, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

## Overview

AI phone agents are transforming customer support by providing instant responses to inquiries, reducing the need for human intervention. This skill will guide you through deploying an AI phone agent to handle common customer questions, such as event details or parking information. For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify Common Questions**: Compile a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from your customers. For example, "Where can I park?" or "What time is the event?"
2. **Set Up AI Agent**: Use a platform like Jotform to create an AI agent. Configure the agent to respond to the identified FAQs. For detailed instructions, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
3. **Generate QR Code or App**: Create a QR code or mobile app that customers can use to access the AI agent. This allows them to ask questions via text or voice.
4. **Forward Calls**: Set up call forwarding from your existing phone number to the AI agent. This ensures that customers can reach the agent directly by calling.
5. **Monitor and Update**: Regularly review the AI agent's performance and update its responses based on new FAQs or changes in information.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example prompt template for AI phone agent
prompt_template = """
You are an AI phone agent for {event_name}. Answer the following questions:
1. Where can I park?
2. What time is the event?
3. How do I contact support?
"""
```

For more examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice**: Regularly update the AI agent with new FAQs to ensure it remains relevant.
- **Common Pitfall**: Avoid using overly complex language in responses. Keep answers clear and concise.

For a comprehensive list of best practices and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Test Responses**: Ensure the AI agent provides accurate answers to all FAQs.
2. **Monitor Call Handling**: Verify that calls are being forwarded correctly and that the agent is handling them efficiently.
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect customer feedback to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

# Detailed Guidelines

## Code Examples

## Code Examples

This document provides code snippets and prompt templates for configuring an AI phone agent.

### Prompt Template

```python
# Example prompt template for AI phone agent
prompt_template = """
You are an AI phone agent for {event_name}. Answer the following questions:
1. Where can I park?
2. What time is the event?
3. How do I contact support?
"""
```

### Call Forwarding Configuration

```bash
# Example call forwarding configuration
call_forwarding_config = {
    "source_number": "+1234567890",
    "destination_number": "+0987654321",
    "enabled": True
}
```

### Monitoring Script

```python
# Example monitoring script
import requests

def monitor_agent_performance(agent_id):
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/agents/{agent_id}/performance")
    return response.json()
```

## Common Pitfalls

## Common Pitfalls

This document outlines common pitfalls and best practices when deploying an AI phone agent.

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Overly Complex Responses**: Using jargon or complex language can confuse customers. Keep responses clear and concise.
2. **Outdated FAQs**: Failing to update the FAQs database can result in inaccurate responses. Regularly review and update the FAQs.
3. **Poor Call Handling**: Incorrect call forwarding settings can lead to missed calls or delays. Test call handling thoroughly.

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep the AI agent's responses up-to-date with the latest information.
2. **Clear Language**: Use simple, straightforward language in responses to ensure customer understanding.
3. **Thorough Testing**: Test the AI agent's responses and call handling before full deployment.

## Core Concepts

## Core Concepts

AI phone agents are automated systems designed to handle customer inquiries via phone calls or text messages. They leverage natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to customer questions in real-time. These agents are particularly useful for businesses that receive a high volume of repetitive questions, such as event organizers or customer support centers.

### Key Components

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables the AI to understand and generate human-like responses.
2. **FAQs Database**: A repository of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers.
3. **Call Forwarding**: Routes incoming calls to the AI agent instead of a human operator.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for human intervention, allowing staff to focus on more complex tasks.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Provides instant responses, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Practical Guide

## Practical Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and deploying an AI phone agent.

### Step 1: Identify Common Questions

Compile a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from your customers. Examples include:
- Where can I park?
- What time is the event?
- How do I contact support?

### Step 2: Set Up AI Agent

1. **Choose a Platform**: Select a platform like Jotform that supports AI phone agents.
2. **Configure Responses**: Input the FAQs and their corresponding answers into the platform.
3. **Test the Agent**: Ensure the agent provides accurate responses to all FAQs.

### Step 3: Generate QR Code or App

1. **Create QR Code**: Generate a QR code that customers can scan to access the AI agent.
2. **Develop Mobile App**: Optionally, create a mobile app that integrates the AI agent.

### Step 4: Forward Calls

1. **Set Up Call Forwarding**: Configure your existing phone number to forward calls to the AI agent.
2. **Test Call Handling**: Verify that calls are being routed correctly.

### Step 5: Monitor and Update

1. **Review Performance**: Regularly check the AI agent's performance and update its responses as needed.
2. **Gather Feedback**: Collect customer feedback to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
