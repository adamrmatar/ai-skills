## Overview

AI phone agents are transforming customer support by providing instant responses to inquiries, reducing the need for human intervention. This skill will guide you through deploying an AI phone agent to handle common customer questions, such as event details or parking information. For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify Common Questions**: Compile a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from your customers. For example, "Where can I park?" or "What time is the event?"
2. **Set Up AI Agent**: Use a platform like Jotform to create an AI agent. Configure the agent to respond to the identified FAQs. For detailed instructions, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
3. **Generate QR Code or App**: Create a QR code or mobile app that customers can use to access the AI agent. This allows them to ask questions via text or voice.
4. **Forward Calls**: Set up call forwarding from your existing phone number to the AI agent. This ensures that customers can reach the agent directly by calling.
5. **Monitor and Update**: Regularly review the AI agent's performance and update its responses based on new FAQs or changes in information.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example prompt template for AI phone agent
prompt_template = """
You are an AI phone agent for {event_name}. Answer the following questions:
1. Where can I park?
2. What time is the event?
3. How do I contact support?
"""
```

For more examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice**: Regularly update the AI agent with new FAQs to ensure it remains relevant.
- **Common Pitfall**: Avoid using overly complex language in responses. Keep answers clear and concise.

For a comprehensive list of best practices and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Test Responses**: Ensure the AI agent provides accurate answers to all FAQs.
2. **Monitor Call Handling**: Verify that calls are being forwarded correctly and that the agent is handling them efficiently.
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect customer feedback to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
