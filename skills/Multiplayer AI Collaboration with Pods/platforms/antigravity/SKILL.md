# Multiplayer AI Collaboration with Pods

## Overview

This skill implements collaborative workflows between multiple AI agents and humans using Dust's pod architecture and flocking algorithm principles. Key concepts are explained in [Flocking Algorithm](references/flocking_algorithm.md) and [Pod Architecture](references/pod_architecture.md).

## Workflow

1. **Initialize Pod**
   ```python
   # Create new collaborative pod
   pod = create_pod(
       name="Team Weekly",
       participants=["pm", "designer", "engineer"],
       shared_fs="gcs://team-weekly-123"
   )
   ```

2. **Spawn Sub-Agents**
   ```python
   # Create specialized agents for each task
   slides_agent = pod.add_agent(
       role="slide_creator",
       skills=["data_analysis", "presentation_design"]
   )
   ```

3. **Implement Flocking Rules**
   - **Local Separation**: Trust-based task ownership
     ```python
     assign_task(agent, task, authority_level="full")
     ```
   - **Distant Attraction**: Cross-reference related work
     ```python
     related_work = find_related_conversations(pod, current_topic)
     ```
   - **Alignment**: Enforce vision constraints
     ```python
     validate_output(task, constraints=["on_brand", "technical_accuracy"])
     ```

4. **Coordinate Work**
   ```python
   # Agent workflow for weekly prep
   def prepare_weekly(pod):
       for slide in weekly_slides:
           session = pod.create_session(owner=slide.owner)
           session.run_task(
               "prepare_slide",
               inputs={"data_sources": slide.sources}
           )
       pod.monitor_completion(deadline="2h_before_meeting")
   ```

5. **Consolidate Outputs**
   ```python
   # Combine all slide frames into final presentation
   final_deck = combine_frames(
       pod.get_files("/pod/slides/*.frame"),
       template="company_standard"
   )
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Bidirectional Design**: Follow principles in [Bidirectional Design](references/bidirectional_design.md)
2. **State Management**:
   - Keep session-specific files in /session
   - Move shared artifacts to /pod
3. **Error Recovery**:
   ```python
   try:
       agent.execute_task()
   except UncertaintyError:
       request_human_input(agent.current_context)
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-Management**: 
   - Bad: Humans micromanaging agent file movements
   - Good: Trust agents to handle /session space

2. **Isolated Work**:
   - Bad: Agents working in private chats
   - Good: All collaboration happens in pod-visible sessions

3. **Vision Drift**:
   - Bad: No alignment checks on outputs
   - Good: Regular validation against core constraints

## Validation

1. **Flocking Verification**:
   - Confirm 3 rules are active in all workflows
   - Check for emergent coordination patterns

2. **Pod Integrity**:
   - Verify file system permissions
   - Test version recovery scenarios

3. **Bidirectional Testing**:
   - Have humans complete agent-created tasks
   - Have agents continue human-started work
