# Agentic Experimentation for High-Stakes ML Systems

## Overview
This skill enables AI agents to safely experiment with and improve high-stakes machine learning systems like fraud detection models. The approach centers around using specialized infrastructure (like [Chronon](references/core_concepts.md)) that provides:
- Safe experimentation environments
- Automated feature engineering
- Production-grade pipeline generation

Key principles from the [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) guide the agent's actions to ensure system stability while enabling rapid iteration.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Establish Isolation**
   - Create a dedicated branch for the experiment
   - Configure isolated compute/storage resources

2. **Feature Modification**
   - Start from existing production feature set
   - Make incremental changes (add/remove/modify features)
   - Use semantic API as shown in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)

3. **Data Generation**
   - Generate training data using platform's backfill capability
   - Leverage automatic compute reuse for unchanged features

4. **Model Training**
   - Train new model version on isolated infrastructure
   - Maintain consistency between training/serving pipelines

5. **Evaluation Packaging**
   - Generate comprehensive experiment report
   - Include:
     - Feature changes
     - Model metrics
     - Resource usage
     - Reproducibility instructions

6. **Human Handoff**
   - Present results for human review
   - Prepare materials for potential AB test

## Best Practices
1. **Incremental Changes**: Focus on small, interpretable modifications rather than wholesale redesigns.
2. **Reuse First**: Always build upon existing production features when possible.
3. **Document Everything**: Ensure every experiment is fully documented for review.
4. **Resource Awareness**: Monitor compute usage and stay within allocated budgets.

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-Experimentation**: Avoid running too many concurrent experiments without proper resource controls.
2. **Production Contamination**: Never allow experimental code to modify production data directly.
3. **Black Box Changes**: Ensure all feature modifications have clear semantics and documentation.
4. **Cost Blindness**: Monitor infrastructure costs which can scale quickly with many experiments.

## Validation Steps
1. **Consistency Checks**: Verify training/serving data pipelines produce identical outputs given same inputs.
2. **Performance Testing**: Ensure new model versions meet latency/QPS requirements.
3. **Reproducibility**: Confirm experiments can be exactly reproduced from their definitions.
4. **Safety Review**: Human verification that all isolation mechanisms worked correctly.
