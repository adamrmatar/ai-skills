name: Agent-Driven Data Platform Migration and Optimization
description: >-
  This skill enables AI agents to migrate and optimize data platforms, focusing on transitioning from human-centric to agent-centric systems. It includes steps for context engineering, query optimization, and handling autonomous agent workloads.
---

## Overview
This skill focuses on migrating and optimizing data platforms to support autonomous AI agents. The core concepts include context engineering, query optimization, and handling autonomous agent workloads. For a detailed understanding, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Assess Current Data Platform**: Evaluate the existing data platform to identify human-centric assumptions and limitations.
2. **Design Context Serving Layer**: Create a context serving layer that provides fresh, joinable, and cheap-to-query runtime data for AI systems. Refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for detailed steps.
3. **Migrate Codebase**: Transition the codebase from Python to Rust, ensuring compatibility with agent-driven workloads.
4. **Optimize Queries**: Implement query optimization techniques to handle autonomous agent workloads efficiently.
5. **Validate and Test**: Ensure the migrated and optimized platform meets performance and reliability standards.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example: Migrating Python code to Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Ensure the context serving layer is scalable and can handle high concurrency.
- **Common Pitfall**: Avoid treating AI agents as faster humans; they require fundamentally different access patterns.

## Validation and Testing
1. **Performance Testing**: Measure query response times and ensure they meet agent-driven workload requirements.
2. **Reliability Testing**: Verify the system's ability to handle continuous, autonomous queries without failure.

For more detailed validation steps, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
