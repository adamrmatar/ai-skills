# Froglet Protocol Integration for AI Agents

## Overview

The Froglet protocol is designed to enhance AI agent capabilities by enabling them to discover, transact with, and receive verifiable receipts from external data and service providers. This skill focuses on integrating Froglet into your AI agent workflows, allowing for seamless collaboration and transaction verification across organizational boundaries.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Install Froglet Locally**: Use Docker to install Froglet on your local machine.
   ```bash
   HBS Froglet Dev Agent
   ```
   This command downloads and installs the Froglet agent on Docker.

2. **Create a Temporary Token**: Generate a temporary token for accessing Froglet services.
   ```bash
   froglet create-token
   ```
   This creates a temporary token valid for 15 minutes.

3. **Define Payload**: Create a payload specifying the service, provider, and input data.
   ```json
   {
     "schema": "add_two_numbers",
     "provider": "example_provider",
     "input": {
       "num1": 7,
       "num2": 5
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Execute Service**: Send the payload to the Froglet node for execution.
   ```bash
   froglet execute --payload payload.json
   ```
   This command sends the payload to the Froglet node and returns a deal ID.

5. **Verify Receipt**: Use the deal ID to verify the receipt of the transaction.
   ```bash
   froglet verify-receipt --deal-id <deal_id>
   ```
   This command verifies the receipt and ensures the transaction is valid.

For detailed code examples and practical guidance, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Best Practices

- **Ensure Compatibility**: Verify that your AI agent framework is compatible with Froglet plugins.
- **Monitor Budgets**: Regularly monitor and manage the budgets allocated to your agents.
- **Validate Receipts**: Always validate receipts to ensure transaction integrity.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Token Expiry**: Ensure tokens are renewed before expiry to avoid service interruptions.
- **Payload Errors**: Double-check payload definitions to prevent execution errors.

## Validation and Testing

- **Test Locally**: Run Froglet locally using Docker to test integration before deploying.
- **Verify Transactions**: Use the `verify-receipt` command to ensure all transactions are correctly recorded.
