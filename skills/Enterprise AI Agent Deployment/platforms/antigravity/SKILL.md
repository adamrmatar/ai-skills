# Enterprise AI Agent Deployment Guide

## Overview
This skill enables you to deploy AI agents as institutional knowledge managers within enterprises. The process follows a progressive value timeline from generic assistants to cross-team synthesizers. Learn more in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Initial Setup** (Week 1)
   - Connect to enterprise knowledge bases using secure APIs
   - Deploy 3-5 generic agents with read-only access
   - Example API call:
     ```python
     import enterprise_connector
     ec = enterprise_connector.KnowledgeBase(
         api_key='SECURE_KEY',
         access_level='read_only'
     )
     ```

2. **Specialization Phase** (Month 1-3)
   - Process code reviews using pattern:
     ```
     Analyze {repository_name} commits from {date_range}:
     1. Identify most common review comments
     2. Extract architecture decisions
     3. Map to knowledge graph nodes
     ```

3. **Cross-Team Synthesis** (Month 4-6)
   - Implement decision tracking with weekly reports
   - Use anomaly detection prompt:
     ```
     Compare {team_A} decisions with {team_B} implementations:
     1. Flag inconsistencies > {threshold}%
     2. Suggest alignment opportunities
     3. Prioritize by impact score
     ```

## Best Practices
- **Security First**: Always start with read-only access
- **Progressive Access**: Expand permissions gradually as trust builds
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain human review for critical connections

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overextension**: Trying to connect all systems too quickly (see Month 3 warnings in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md))
- **Knowledge Silos**: Failing to enforce cross-team synthesis (Month 6 requirements in [Deployment Workflow](references/deployment_workflow.md))

## Validation Steps
1. Weekly knowledge graph accuracy tests
2. Monthly cross-team synthesis audits
3. Quarterly productivity impact assessments

## Maintenance
Follow the ongoing procedures outlined in [Deployment Workflow](references/deployment_workflow.md) to maintain optimal performance.
