name: Production Evaluation for Agentic AI Systems
description: >-
  A comprehensive skill for evaluating agentic AI systems in production environments, focusing on workflow behavior, reliability, and continuous monitoring.
---

## Overview

Agentic AI systems have fundamentally changed the landscape of AI evaluation. Unlike traditional models that generate answers, agentic systems plan, call tools, retrieve information, execute workflows, and interact with production infrastructure. This shift necessitates a new approach to evaluation that focuses on system behavior rather than just model outputs.

### Core Concepts

1. **Workflow Evaluation**: Instead of evaluating individual outputs, assess the entire workflow, including planning quality, tool usage, execution, and recovery from failures.
2. **Production Telemetry**: Utilize real user interactions and system behavior data as the most valuable evaluation signals.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing evaluation to detect and address system drift and reliability degradation.
4. **Reliability Metrics**: Focus on metrics like task completion, tool success, escalation rate, safety violations, latency, cost, and recovery rate.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Define Evaluation Scenarios**: Identify key workflows that the agentic system will perform, such as customer support, code generation, or research workflows.
2. **Simulate Workflows**: Create simulated environments where the agent operates, and measure task completion rate, tool correctness, planning quality, and resource usage.
3. **Collect Production Telemetry**: Continuously gather execution traces, user outcomes, escalations, failures, and feedback signals from real user interactions.
4. **Implement Continuous Monitoring**: Set up observability tools to capture detailed traces of reasoning paths, tool calls, memory access, execution timelines, and state transitions.
5. **Combine Automated and Human Evaluation**: Use automated metrics for scalability and targeted human reviews for assessing correctness, trust, usefulness, and safety.
6. **Analyze and Iterate**: Regularly analyze evaluation data to identify drift, improve workflows, and update evaluation pipelines.

For practical implementation steps, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example: Setting up continuous monitoring for an agentic system
import logging
import traceback

class AgentMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger('AgentMonitor')
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    def log_execution_trace(self, trace):
        self.logger.info(f'Execution Trace: {trace}')

    def log_failure(self, exception):
        self.logger.error(f'Failure: {exception}', exc_info=True)

# Usage
monitor = AgentMonitor()
monitor.log_execution_trace('Tool call: retrieve_info')
monitor.log_failure(Exception('Tool execution failed'))
```

For more code examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Scenario-Driven Evaluation**: Focus on evaluating entire workflows rather than individual prompts.
- **Combine Metrics**: Use a combination of reliability, availability, latency, cost, and recovery metrics.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing evaluation to detect and address system drift.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Reliance on Benchmarks**: Benchmarks measure model capability but miss system behavior.
- **Ignoring Human Feedback**: Humans provide critical signals that automated systems cannot.
- **Neglecting Drift Detection**: Without continuous monitoring, reliability degradation can go unnoticed.

For detailed best practices and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Scenario Validation**: Validate simulated workflows against real-world scenarios to ensure accuracy and relevance.
2. **Telemetry Accuracy**: Verify that collected telemetry data accurately reflects system behavior.
3. **Metric Calibration**: Calibrate evaluation metrics using human feedback to ensure they capture the correct signals.
4. **Drift Detection Testing**: Test continuous monitoring systems to ensure they can detect and alert on system drift.
