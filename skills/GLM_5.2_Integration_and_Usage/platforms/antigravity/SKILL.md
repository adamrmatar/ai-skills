  Learn how to integrate and effectively use GLM 5.2, an open-source local AI model, with tools like Cursor, OpenRouter, and Codex for cost-efficient and high-performance AI workflows.
---

## Overview
GLM 5.2 is an open-source local AI model that offers a cost-efficient alternative to closed models like OpenAI's GPT. It can be integrated with tools such as Cursor, OpenRouter, and Codex to optimize token usage and enhance productivity. This skill will guide you through setting up GLM 5.2, using it for specific tasks, and leveraging model chaining for optimal results.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Obtain API Key**: Visit Z AI, the provider of GLM 5.2, and obtain an API key.
2. **Setup in Cursor**:
   - Open Cursor settings.
   - Paste the GLM API key into the OpenAI field.
   - Override the OpenAI endpoint with the GLM endpoint.
   - Add GLM 5.2 as a custom model.
3. **Setup in OpenRouter**:
   - Obtain an OpenRouter API key.
   - Configure OpenRouter to use GLM 5.2.
4. **Model Chaining**: Use Opus 4.8 for tasks requiring vision capabilities and GLM 5.2 for execution-based tasks.
5. **Run Tasks**: Execute tasks using GLM 5.2 through Cursor or OpenRouter.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of setting up GLM 5.2 in Cursor
import cursor

cursor.set_api_key('your_glm_api_key')
cursor.set_endpoint('https://api.zai.com/glm5.2')
cursor.add_model('GLM 5.2', 'glm5.2')
```

## Best Practices
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use GLM 5.2 for tasks where token cost is a concern.
- **Model Chaining**: Combine GLM 5.2 with other models for tasks requiring different capabilities.
- **Local Execution**: Run GLM 5.2 locally to save on cloud token costs.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Resource Intensive**: Ensure your machine has sufficient GPU RAM to run GLM 5.2 locally.
- **Benchmark Misinterpretation**: Focus on practical performance rather than benchmark scores.

## Validation and Testing
- **Task Execution**: Run a series of tasks using GLM 5.2 and compare the results with other models.
- **Cost Analysis**: Compare the token cost of using GLM 5.2 versus other models.
