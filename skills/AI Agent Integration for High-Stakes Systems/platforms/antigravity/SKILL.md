# AI Agent Integration for High-Stakes Systems

## Overview
This skill enables AI agents to safely and effectively integrate into high-stakes systems like fraud detection and personalization. Instead of replacing existing models, agents improve them through controlled experimentation. Key concepts include infrastructure automation, safe experimentation, and reproducible results. For more details, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install Chronon and configure resource limits. See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for details.
2. **Define Features**: Use Chronon's semantic API to define new features or modify existing ones. Example code is available in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
3. **Run Experiments**: Create a branch, modify features, and train new model versions. Ensure experiments are isolated and leverage compute reuse.
4. **Review and Deploy**: Human review is mandatory before any changes proceed to production. Monitor performance in dev before full rollout.

## Best Practices
- **Isolate Resources**: Always use branch-based isolation to prevent interference with production.
- **Reuse Compute**: Leverage Chronon's caching to minimize redundant computations.
- **Human Oversight**: Never skip the human review step for high-stakes systems.

## Common Pitfalls
Avoid direct modification of production infrastructure, redundant computations, and lack of human review. For more pitfalls and solutions, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure experiments can be rerun with the same results.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance in dev before production deployment.
- **Cost Control**: Use resource limits to manage experimentation costs.

## Reconciling Differences
All sources agree on the importance of infrastructure automation, safe experimentation, and human oversight. The provided workflow and best practices synthesize these insights into a cohesive approach.
