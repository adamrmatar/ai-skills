# Multi-Agent Verification System

## Overview
Implement NASA Mission Control-style verification for high-stakes AI decisions. This skill teaches you to build systems where:
- Multiple specialized agents collaborate
- Every output undergoes verification
- Disagreements trigger safety protocols

Key concepts explained in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define Decision Criticality**
   - Use stakes assessment: "What's the worst-case impact of being wrong?"
   - Apply multi-agent only when consequences are severe (health, legal, financial)

2. **Design Agent Roles**
   - Generator: First-draft creator
   - Verifier: Fact-checker (reference [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for templates)
   - Adversary: Devil's advocate

3. **Implement Verification Protocol**
   ```python
   def multi_agent_decision(input):
       draft = generator(input)
       verification = verifier(draft)
       challenges = adversary(draft)
       
       if verification["status"] == "verified" and not challenges:
           return {"decision": draft, "confidence": "high"}
       elif len(challenges) < 2:
           return {"decision": draft, "confidence": "medium", "warnings": challenges}
       else:
           return {"decision": "ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN", "reasons": challenges}
   ```

4. **Configure Escalation Paths**
   - Define thresholds for human intervention
   - Implement audit trails for all decisions

5. **Validate System**
   - Follow testing protocols from [Validation Protocols](references/validation_protocols.md)
   - Measure both accuracy and safety metrics

## Best Practices
1. **Role Specialization**
   - Train verifiers on common error patterns
   - Give adversaries access to edge case databases

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run verifier/adversary in parallel when possible
   - Cache frequent verification results

3. **Transparency**
   - Provide explanation trails for all decisions
   - Surface confidence levels to end-users

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-Verification**
   - Example: Applying full MAS to movie recommendations
   - Fix: Use stakes assessment to right-size architecture

2. **Homogeneous Agents**
   - Example: Verifier using same knowledge base as generator
   - Fix: Ensure independent knowledge sources

3. **Protocol Gaps**
   - Example: No clear rules for tie-breaking
   - Fix: Implement NASA-style go-no-go voting

## Validation Steps
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Verify each agent's individual competence
   - Test orchestration logic

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Validate full decision flows
   - Measure end-to-end latency

3. **Adversarial Testing**
   - Attempt to deliberately provoke failures
   - Verify safety nets activate properly

Example Test Case:
```python
test_case = {
    "input": "Approve loan for $2M commercial property",
    "expected_checks": ["credit history", "collateral valuation", "debt-to-income"]
}
assert "debt-to-income" in adversary(test_case["input"])["challenges"]
```
