name: Decision-Aware AI Agent Framework
description: >-
  A comprehensive framework for building decision-aware AI agents using context graphs, memory, and reasoning capabilities to enhance decision-making processes.
---

## Overview

This skill provides a framework for building decision-aware AI agents using context graphs, memory, and reasoning capabilities. The goal is to enhance the decision-making process by providing agents with the necessary tools to understand the 'why' behind actions, not just the 'how'. This framework leverages Neo4j's graph database to capture and manage contextual knowledge, policies, and rules.

### Core Concepts

- **Context Graphs**: Graphs that capture the relationships and connections between different types of data, enabling AI agents to understand the context of their decisions.
- **Memory**: Divided into short-term memory (capturing conversations and state history) and long-term memory (capturing generalized knowledge about organizations, people, etc.).
- **Reasoning**: The process by which an AI agent determines why it should perform a certain task based on predefined policies and rules.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Frame the Problem**: Understand the local context and the causality that led to the current situation.
2. **Capture Context**: Use short-term and long-term memory to capture relevant information.
3. **Apply Reasoning**: Use predefined policies and rules to determine the 'why' behind the decision.
4. **Analyze Risks and Values**: Perform a risk-value analysis to evaluate the potential outcomes of the decision.
5. **Generate Alternatives**: Propose multiple alternatives with pros and cons for each.
6. **Make the Decision**: Hand off the decision to an agent with the authority to act or escalate to a higher authority.
7. **Record the Decision**: Save the entire reasoning process and decision into the graph for future reference.

For a detailed guide on implementing this workflow, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example: Querying a Neo4j graph database for contextual information
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def query_context_graph(query):
    with driver.session() as session:
        result = session.run(query)
        return result.data()

# Example query
query = "MATCH (n:Person)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company) RETURN n.name, c.name"
context_data = query_context_graph(query)
print(context_data)
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Ensure that decisions are consistent with previous actions and global rules.
- **Explicitness**: Make implicit knowledge explicit by clearly defining policies and rules.
- **Traceability**: Record the entire reasoning process for accountability and future reference.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overgeneralization**: Avoid assuming that what works in most cases will work in all cases. Always consider the specifics of the situation.
- **Ignoring Context**: Failing to capture and utilize the full context can lead to poor decisions.
- **Lack of Oversight**: Ensure there is a mechanism for human or higher-privilege agent oversight when necessary.

For more on best practices and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of the decision-making process, such as querying the graph database and applying reasoning.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure that all components work together seamlessly.
3. **Scenario Testing**: Test the framework with real-world scenarios to validate its effectiveness.
4. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the framework under different loads and conditions.
