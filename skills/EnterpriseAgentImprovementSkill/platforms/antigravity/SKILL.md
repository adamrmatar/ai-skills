  A skill to improve enterprise AI agents by addressing ambiguity, staleness, and preference issues through structured knowledge bases, context lifecycle management, and feedback loops.
---

## Overview
Enterprise AI agents often face three main problems: ambiguity, staleness, and preference. Ambiguity arises when the agent doesn't know which data source or knowledge base to use. Staleness occurs when the context becomes outdated. Preference issues emerge when different teams or individuals have varying definitions or metrics. This skill provides a structured approach to address these issues.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Identify Sources of Truth**: Divide knowledge bases into three layers: semantic layer, canonical tables, and database graph. Start from the cleanest source and move to the most dynamic one.
2. **Create a Context Lifecycle**: Embed live data sources and establish a feedback loop to keep the context updated.
3. **Capture Preferences**: Store individual or team preferences in a semantic layer or agent memory.
4. **Evaluate and Update**: Regularly evaluate the agent's performance and update the context based on feedback.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of embedding live data sources
live_data_sources = ['GitHub', 'CRM', 'Tableau', 'DBT']
for source in live_data_sources:
    embed_data(source)

# Example of creating a feedback loop
def log_event(event):
    with open('feedback_log.md', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f'{event}\n')

# Example of evaluating agent performance
def evaluate_agent(questions, answers):
    for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
        if q != a:
            log_event(f'Incorrect answer for question: {q}')
```

## Best Practices
- **Hierarchical Knowledge Bases**: Always start from the cleanest source of truth and move to the most dynamic one.
- **Regular Updates**: Ensure that live data sources are regularly updated and reviewed.
- **Feedback Loop**: Capture and log every event that indicates a change in context or preference.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Equal Weighting of Knowledge Bases**: Avoid treating all knowledge bases equally. Use a hierarchical approach.
- **Outdated Context**: Regularly update the context to avoid staleness.
- **Ignoring Preferences**: Capture and store individual or team preferences to avoid ambiguity.

## Validation Steps
1. **Human Annotated Questions**: Curate a set of questions with human-annotated answers to evaluate the agent.
2. **Automated Evaluation**: Compare the agent's answers to actual answers from the last few days.
3. **Feedback Review**: Regularly review the feedback log to identify and address issues.
