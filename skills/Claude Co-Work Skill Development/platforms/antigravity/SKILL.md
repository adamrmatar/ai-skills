# Claude Co-Work Skill Development SOP

## Overview
This skill enables you to develop, test, and optimize AI agent skills within Claude Co-Work. It covers the full lifecycle from initial setup to advanced optimization techniques. Key concepts are explained in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure Claude Pro/Enterprise account
   - Install desktop app
   - Enable co-work tab

2. **Project Configuration**
   - Create projects for different workflows
   - Connect relevant folders
   - Set project-specific instructions
   - Detailed steps in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md)

3. **Connector Integration**
   - Prioritize native connectors
   - Search for MCP servers before using browser
   - Install custom MCP servers when needed (see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md))

4. **Skill Development**
   - Define skill purpose and triggers
   - Gather reference files (style guides, examples, etc.)
   - Outline step-by-step process with human checkpoints
   - Add rules for edge cases

5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Run initial functionality tests
   - Conduct focused evaluations on specific criteria
   - Perform AB tests between skill versions
   - Implement progressive updates

## Best Practices
- **Context Engineering**: Keep skill.md focused on process, offload details to reference files
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Use QA boxes for critical decisions
- **Variation Generation**: Request multiple options for human selection
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structure skills to load context only when needed

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Overusing Browser**: Leads to token-heavy, expensive operations
   - Fix: Always check for MCP servers first

2. **Vague Skill Definitions**: Results in inconsistent outputs
   - Fix: Use precise process descriptions

3. **Testing Too Many Factors**: Makes optimization unclear
   - Fix: Focus on one improvement area per test

4. **Ignoring Reference Files**: Leads to generic outputs
   - Fix: Make file usage mandatory in skill rules

## Validation Steps
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all process steps complete
   - Check output file generation

2. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Assess against style guides
   - Measure consistency with examples

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Compare token usage
   - Time execution speed

4. **AB Testing**
   - Compare against baseline
   - Test different versions

Use the templates in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md) for consistent testing.
