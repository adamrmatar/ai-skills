# Agent Monitoring and Analytics Skill

## Overview
Effective agent monitoring requires shifting from traditional session-based analytics to **run-level telemetry** that captures workflow success, user trust signals, and permission boundaries. Learn more in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Instrument Agent Runs**
   - Generate unique run IDs at task initiation
   - Tag all subsequent events (tool calls, approvals) with this ID
   - Implement the [tracking decorator pattern](references/code_examples.md) for critical operations

2. **Capture Three Key Events**
   - **Run Start**: User intent and workflow classification
   - **Mid-Run Corrections**: User edits/denials (tag with [schema](references/practical_guide.md))
   - **Completion**: Final state and user acceptance

3. **Build Analytical Views**
   - Completion vs acceptance rate divergence
   - Correction heatmaps by workflow step
   - Permission failure clusters

4. **Implement Guardrails**
   - Auto-throttle workflows with >20% correction rates
   - Require manual approval for actions with frequent permission errors

## Best Practices
- **Correlation**: Pipe engineering traces (API errors) into the same run context as product events
- **Thresholds**: Investigate workflows where correction rates exceed 15%
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag runs with:
  - Multiple permission boundary violations
  - Excessive retries on destructive operations

## Common Pitfalls
- **Vanity Metrics**: Monitoring chat volume instead of work completion (as in the database deletion incident)
- **Over-Reliance on Traces**: Engineering data alone won't reveal if failures impacted user trust
- **Late Detection**: Missing correction patterns that predict major failures

## Validation Steps
1. **Test Instrumentation**
   - Verify run IDs persist across all events in a workflow
   - Confirm destructive operations emit criticality flags

2. **Benchmark Metrics**
   - Establish baseline completion/acceptance rates by workflow
   - Set SLOs for maximum correction rates

3. **Simulate Failures**
   - Trigger permission errors in test runs
   - Verify correction events appear in analytics
