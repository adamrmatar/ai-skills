### Overview
Gemini 3.5 Flash is a powerful multimodal AI model that excels in tasks involving image analysis, video understanding, document processing, and structured data extraction. This skill will guide you through the core concepts and practical workflows to leverage Gemini 3.5 Flash effectively.

### Core Concepts
Before diving into the workflows, it's essential to understand the core concepts of multimodal AI interaction. Refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) for a detailed explanation.

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Image Analysis**
   - Upload an image to the Gemini app.
   - Use the following prompt template:
     ```
     Look at everything in this image and provide a detailed analysis. Include any relevant steps or actions based on the content.
     ```
   - Validate the output by cross-checking with the actual image.

2. **Video Understanding**
   - Drag and drop a video file directly into the Gemini app.
   - Use the following prompt template:
     ```
     Give me the top five insights from this video with exact timestamps. Then find the data table shown around the 23-minute mark and recreate it as a Python chart.
     ```
   - Validate the insights by checking them against the actual video.

3. **Document Processing**
   - Upload a document to AI Studio.
   - Use the following prompt template:
     ```
     Act as a contract lawyer. Read this entire agreement and flag every hidden fee, automatic renewal clause, and penalty that a client could miss on a first read.
     ```
   - Switch the thinking level from low to high for more accurate results.

4. **Structured Data Extraction**
   - Upload multiple receipt photos to AI Studio.
   - Define your schema visually in the structured output panel.
   - Use the following prompt template:
     ```
     Extract clean structured data from all these receipts without writing a single line of API code.
     ```
   - Validate the JSON output for accuracy.

### Code/Prompt Snippets
Refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md) for detailed code snippets and prompt templates.

### Best Practices
- Always validate the output by cross-checking with the actual content.
- Use high thinking levels for tasks requiring high accuracy.
- Keep your prompts specific to stay on track.

### Common Pitfalls
- Avoid using low thinking levels for critical tasks.
- Be cautious of the default thinking level change from high to medium.
- Validate long context retrieval manually.

### Validation and Testing
- Cross-check insights with actual video content.
- Validate JSON output against the original receipts.
- Manually verify long context retrieval.
