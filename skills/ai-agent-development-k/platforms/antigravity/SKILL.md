# AI Agent Development Skill

## Overview
This skill focuses on developing AI agents with a strong emphasis on observability and domain modeling. The core concepts include understanding the architecture of AI agents, implementing observability platforms, and using domain-driven design principles to structure your projects.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Idea Generation**: Start by brainstorming project ideas that are useful in everyday work and have both front-end and back-end components.
2. **Research**: Conduct thorough research on existing coding agents and their observability features.
3. **Domain Modeling**: Use domain-driven design principles to model the domain of your project.
4. **Implementation**: Implement the project using TypeScript, ensuring that it is pluggable and can be hosted locally.
5. **Validation**: Validate the idea early by creating a minimal viable product (MVP) and testing it in a real-world scenario.

## Code Snippets
```typescript
// Example TypeScript code for a simple AI agent
class SimpleAgent {
  constructor() {
    // Initialize the agent
  }

  async process(input: string): Promise<string> {
    // Process the input and return the output
    return `Processed: ${input}`;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
- **Early Validation**: Always validate your idea early to ensure it meets user needs.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Design your system to be pluggable so users can host their own versions.
- **Observability**: Implement observability features to monitor agent performance and usage.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overcomplicating Authentication**: Avoid implementing complex authentication systems early on. Start with simpler methods and upgrade later.
- **Ignoring Domain Modeling**: Skipping domain modeling can lead to a poorly structured codebase. Always model your domain first.

## Validation and Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each component of your agent.
- **Integration Tests**: Perform integration tests to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and improve the system.
