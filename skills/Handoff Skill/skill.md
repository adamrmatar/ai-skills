### Overview
The Handoff Skill is designed to facilitate the transfer of context and intent from one AI agent to another. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a task needs to be handed off to a different agent for specialized processing or when the context window of the current agent is nearing its limit.

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Initiate Handoff**: Trigger the handoff process by instructing the agent to create a handoff document.
2. **Summarize Conversation**: The agent compacts the current conversation into a concise summary.
3. **Suggest Skills**: The agent suggests relevant skills for the next session based on the context.
4. **Create Temporary File**: The agent writes the handoff document to a temporary file.
5. **Read Before Write**: Ensure the file is read before writing to avoid errors in Claude.
6. **Reference Artifacts**: Avoid duplicating content by referencing existing artifacts by path or URL.
7. **Tailor Document**: If user arguments are provided, tailor the document to focus on the specified aspects.
8. **Handoff to New Agent**: Provide the path of the handoff document to the new agent to continue the work.

### Code/Prompt Snippets
```python
# Example command to initiate handoff
handoff_command = "/handoff"

# Example prompt for summarizing conversation
summary_prompt = "Summarize the current conversation for handoff to another agent."

# Example code snippet for creating a temporary file
import tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, prefix='handoff_', suffix='.txt') as temp_file:
    temp_file.write(summary.encode('utf-8'))
    handoff_path = temp_file.name
```

### Best Practices
- **Clear Summarization**: Ensure the summary captures the essence of the conversation, including context and intent.
- **Skill Suggestion**: Accurately suggest skills that align with the next session's goals.
- **File Handling**: Always read the file before writing to avoid errors in Claude.
- **Artifact Reference**: Reference existing artifacts to avoid redundancy.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Incomplete Summary**: Failing to capture all relevant details can lead to confusion in the next session.
- **Incorrect Skill Suggestion**: Suggesting irrelevant skills can derail the next session.
- **File Handling Errors**: Not reading the file before writing can cause errors in Claude.
- **Redundant Content**: Duplicating content from existing artifacts can lead to inefficiency.

### Validation Steps
1. **Review Summary**: Ensure the summary accurately reflects the conversation.
2. **Check Skill Suggestions**: Verify that the suggested skills are relevant to the next session.
3. **File Integrity**: Confirm that the handoff document is correctly written and readable.
4. **Artifact References**: Ensure all referenced artifacts are correctly linked.
