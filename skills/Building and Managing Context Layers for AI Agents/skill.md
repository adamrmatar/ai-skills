## Overview

The context layer is a critical infrastructure component for AI agents, enabling them to understand and utilize business-specific knowledge, expertise, and norms. This skill will guide you through the process of building and managing context layers to enhance agent performance.

### Core Concepts

- **Context Layer**: A system that turns business knowledge, expertise, and norms into machine-usable context for AI systems.
- **Domain Skills**: Specific skills that agents develop over time, such as SEO or competitive intelligence.
- **Context Engineering**: The process of embedding business context into AI agents.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify Business Context Sources**: Determine where business context is stored (e.g., Slack threads, dashboards, CRM systems).
2. **Build Domain Skills**: Develop specific skills for agents (e.g., SEO, competitive intelligence).
3. **Create a Context Layer**: Aggregate and structure context into a machine-usable format.
4. **Integrate with Agents**: Connect the context layer to AI agents for real-time context retrieval.
5. **Manage and Update Context**: Continuously update and version control the context layer.

For detailed instructions, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example: Building a Context Layer
from context_layer import ContextLayer

context_layer = ContextLayer()
context_layer.add_source('Slack', 'slack_api_key')
context_layer.add_source('CRM', 'crm_api_key')
context_layer.build()
```

For more examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Treat context like code with versioning and dependency management.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement self-improving loops for agents.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Context Sprawl**: Avoid having agents learn separately and differently.
- **Security Risks**: Ensure secrets are not hardcoded in .env files.

For more insights, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Accuracy Testing**: Verify that agents retrieve accurate context.
2. **Performance Testing**: Ensure agents perform efficiently with the context layer.
3. **Security Audits**: Regularly audit the context layer for security vulnerabilities.

## Reconciliation of Sources

All sources emphasize the importance of context layers and domain skills. The workflow and best practices are consistent across sources, with additional insights from practical implementations.
