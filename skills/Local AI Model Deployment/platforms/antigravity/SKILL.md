# Local AI Model Deployment Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to deploy and utilize local AI models as a resilient alternative to cloud-based AI services. Learn to set up runtimes, select appropriate models, manage hardware requirements, and apply quantization techniques. [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) provides foundational knowledge.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Choose Your Runtime**
   - Technical users: Install Ollama (`brew install ollama`)
   - Non-technical users: Download LM Studio (GUI version)

2. **Select Model Based on Hardware**
   ```bash
   # For 16GB RAM machine (Ollama example)
   ollama pull qwen:12b
   ```

3. **Apply Quantization**
   - Always prefer Q4 or higher quantization levels
   - Example quantized model: `qwen:12b-q4`

4. **Manage Context Window**
   - Keep sessions under 4096 tokens for 12B models
   - Implement session splitting for large documents

5. **Integrate Tools**
   ```python
   # Sample tool integration for file access
   from hermestools import FileSystem
   fs = FileSystem('/path/to/workspace')
   ```

6. **Deploy Agent Profile**
   - Configure Hermes or similar agent to point to local model
   - Set up Telegram/Slack integration for remote access

## Best Practices
1. **Hardware Matching**: Never run models larger than your RAM can handle (see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for exact specifications)
2. **Quantization**: Always use the highest quantization level your quality requirements allow
3. **Session Management**: Reset contexts frequently to prevent memory overload
4. **Tool Augmentation**: Equip smaller models with web search and code execution

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Oversized Models**: Attempting to run 70B models on consumer laptops
2. **Context Bloat**: Loading entire documents instead of relevant excerpts
3. **Tool Forgetting**: Local models sometimes "forget" their tools - implement regular tool reminders
4. **Response Timing**: DeepSeek models may take 10-30s to respond - this is normal

## Validation Steps
1. **Basic Functionality Test**:
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen:12b "Explain quantum computing simply"
   ```
   Verify coherent response within expected time

2. **Privacy Verification**:
   - Run model in airplane mode
   - Confirm continued functionality

3. **Performance Benchmark**:
   - Time response for 5 complex queries
   - Compare against cloud alternatives for "good enough" threshold

4. **Tool Integration Test**:
   - Verify file system access
   - Confirm web search functionality when online

## Reconciliation
All sources agree on the core value proposition of local models (privacy, cost, resilience). The transcript provides current (2026) perspective on model capabilities and hardware requirements, which supersede older benchmarks. Practical recommendations align across all sections when accounting for technological progression.
