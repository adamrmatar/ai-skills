description: >-
  This skill enables you to implement and optimize advanced voice interaction models like GPT Live, leveraging full-duplex architecture for continuous, natural conversations. It includes best practices for integrating voice-first AI into workflows, handling interruptions, and delegating tasks to background models.

## Overview
Advanced voice interaction models like GPT Live revolutionize how users interact with AI by enabling continuous, natural conversations. Unlike traditional turn-based systems, GPT Live uses a full-duplex architecture, allowing simultaneous listening and speaking. This creates a more human-like interaction, reducing latency and improving user experience.

For a deeper dive into the core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up GPT Live**: Integrate GPT Live into your system using the provided API. Ensure your environment supports full-duplex communication.
2. **Configure Continuous Interaction**: Enable the continuous interaction mode to allow GPT Live to process input while generating output.
3. **Delegate Background Tasks**: Use GPT Live's ability to summon other models (e.g., GPT 5.6) for tasks like reasoning or searching while maintaining the conversation.
4. **Optimize for Latency**: Minimize latency by ensuring your system can handle real-time processing. Use efficient algorithms for speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions.
5. **Test Interruptions**: Simulate various interruption scenarios to ensure GPT Live handles pauses and interruptions naturally.

For practical implementation details, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example: Setting up GPT Live for continuous interaction
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-live",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can I assist you today?"}],
  continuous_interaction=True
)
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

For more code examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices
- **Context Management**: Provide ample context to GPT Live to improve response quality.
- **Natural Interruptions**: Train the model to handle natural pauses and interruptions gracefully.
- **Background Tasks**: Delegate complex tasks to specialized models to maintain conversation flow.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Latency Issues**: High latency can disrupt the natural flow of conversation. Optimize your system for real-time processing.
- **Context Loss**: Ensure context is maintained across interactions to avoid disjointed responses.

For a detailed discussion on pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
1. **Latency Testing**: Measure the time taken for GPT Live to respond in various scenarios.
2. **Interruption Handling**: Test how well GPT Live handles interruptions and pauses.
3. **Task Delegation**: Verify that background tasks are correctly delegated and completed.
