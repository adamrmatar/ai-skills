## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Client Identification**
   - Use AI to find businesses with:
     - Active ads but no live chat
     - No booking flow on landing pages
   - Example prompt for Claude:
     ```
     Find 10 local car dealerships in [CITY] running Instagram ads but with no live chat functionality on their website. For each, provide:
     1. Business name
     2. Website URL
     3. Visible gap analysis
     4. First line of outreach message
     ```

2. **Website Creation**
   - Input client info (name, location, specialty)
   - Upload brand aesthetic reference image
   - Let AI generate mobile-responsive site with:
     - SSL certificate
     - Multiple auto-generated pages
     - Custom styling

3. **Agent Training**
   - Upload knowledge base spreadsheet:
     ```
     For car dealers: make, model, year, price, availability, financing options
     For realtors: address, beds, baths, price, availability, features
     ```
   - Test agent with sample questions

4. **Booking System Integration**
   - Connect Calendly or similar
   - Set availability parameters
   - Test booking flow end-to-end

5. **Marketing Campaign Setup**
   - Generate ad creatives from site data
   - Build campaign structure with AI:
     ```
     Create a Meta ads campaign for a [CAR DEALER/REALTOR] in [LOCATION] with:
     - $20/day budget
     - 5-mile radius target
     - Primary goal: [TEST DRIVES/VIEWING APPOINTMENTS]
     Provide:
     1. Recommended audience segments
     2. Ad set structure
     3. 3 copy variants per creative
     ```
   - [Marketing Integration](references/marketing_integration.md)

6. **Launch & Monitor**
   - Publish site (hosting handled automatically)
   - Start small ad tests
   - Review chat logs weekly

## Best Practices
- **White-label everything**: Clients should see your brand, not tool providers
- **Start small**: $20/day ad tests before scaling
- **Right conversion goals**:
  - Car dealers: optimize for test drive bookings
  - Realtors: optimize for viewing form submissions
- **Monthly maintenance**:
  - Car dealers: 90-second CSV updates
  - Realtors: 45-minute asset refreshes

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-generating pages**: Burns through platform credits fast
   - Fix: Prototype first, generate final version later
2. **Impatient clients**: Especially in real estate where conversions take longer
   - Fix: Set proper expectations about 1-week warm-up
3. **Complex use cases**: Not suitable for e-commerce with deep backend logic
   - Fix: Stick to marketing sites and lead generation

## Validation Steps
1. Test agent with 10+ sample questions from each category
2. Verify booking links work and sync to client calendar
3. Confirm mobile responsiveness on multiple devices
4. Check ad creative matches brand aesthetic
5. Ensure white-labeling hides all third-party branding

## Maintenance Routine
- [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) details the monthly workflow:
  - For car dealers:
    - Monthly CSV updates (90 seconds)
    - Review chat logs for edge cases
  - For realtors:
    - Refresh hero images
    - Update featured listings
    - Regenerate one ad creative
    - Review performance metrics
