## Overview

Building a robust AI agent architecture requires a clear separation of concerns to handle the rapid evolution of models, tools, and frameworks. This skill focuses on decoupling the architecture into three layers: **Execution**, **Context**, and **Compute**. The execution layer is the most stable and critical for ensuring durability, observability, and flexibility. Learn more about the core concepts in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify the Layers**: Separate your architecture into Execution, Context, and Compute layers. The Execution layer handles flow, state, and retries; the Context layer manages models, prompts, and tools; and the Compute layer deals with sandboxes and runtimes.

2. **Design the Execution Layer**: Focus on durability, resumability, and observability. Ensure that state is external and durable, allowing the system to resume after failures. Implement flexible orchestration primitives for crons, event triggers, and sub-agent coordination. See practical examples in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

3. **Decouple Context and Compute**: Keep the Context layer independent of the Compute layer. This allows you to swap models, prompts, or sandboxes without affecting the Execution layer.

4. **Implement Observability**: Ensure full session traces across LLM calls, tool calls, and system errors. This is crucial for debugging and improving your agent. Use tools like Ingest for durable execution and observability.

5. **Test and Validate**: Validate your architecture by simulating failures and ensuring resumability. Test different invocation patterns (crons, event triggers) and observe the system's behavior. Detailed validation steps are provided in [Validation Steps](references/validation_steps.md).

## Code Snippets

```python
# Example of a durable execution layer
from ingest import ExecutionLayer

execution_layer = ExecutionLayer()
execution_layer.run(task, retries=3, state_store='external')
```

## Best Practices

- **Decouple Layers**: Avoid merging layers to prevent technical debt. For example, don't embed orchestration logic within the Context layer.
- **External State**: Store state externally to ensure resumability. Avoid relying on in-memory or disk-based state for long-running tasks.
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Use primitives like crons, event triggers, and sub-agent coordination to handle various invocation patterns.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Tight Coupling**: Merging layers leads to inflexibility and technical debt. For example, embedding retry logic within prompts makes it hard to swap models.
- **In-Memory State**: Relying on in-memory state for long-running tasks results in lost work during failures.
- **Poor Observability**: Lack of full session traces makes debugging and improving agents difficult.

## Validation Steps

1. **Simulate Failures**: Test how your system handles failures in LLM calls, tool calls, and sandboxes.
2. **Check Resumability**: Ensure the system can resume from the point of failure without restarting.
3. **Test Invocation Patterns**: Validate crons, event triggers, and sub-agent coordination.
4. **Observe Traces**: Verify that full session traces are available for debugging and analysis.
