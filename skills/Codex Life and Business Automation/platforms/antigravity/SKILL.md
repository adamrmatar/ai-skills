## Overview

This skill teaches you how to use Codex with GPT 5.6 to automate repetitive tasks, manage emails, and build SaaS applications. The core idea is to transform Codex into your personal operating system for both life and business. For a deeper dive into the core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Download and Set Up Codex**: Install Codex and grant it access to your computer. This allows Codex to interact with your local files and applications.
2. **Configure Email Automation**: Use Codex to manage your inbox by creating a system that summarizes emails and drafts replies. For detailed steps, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
3. **Build SaaS Applications**: Develop SaaS apps like 'Turnaround' to display maintenance activities. Use Codex to generate code and manage the app lifecycle. See [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md) for sample code snippets.
4. **Train Custom Models**: If your automation needs are not met by existing models, fine-tune your own models using Codex. This is particularly useful for specialized tasks like copy editing.
5. **Integrate with Other Tools**: Connect Codex with tools like Slack and GitHub to streamline workflows and automate tasks across platforms.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example: Automating Email Summarization
prompt = "Summarize the following email and draft a reply:"
email_content = "Dear Team, Please find attached the report for Q2. Best regards, John"
response = codex.generate(prompt + email_content)
print(response)
```

For more examples, check out [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice**: Start with simple tasks and gradually build up your automation system. This helps you understand Codex's capabilities without overwhelming yourself.
- **Common Pitfall**: Avoid using Codex CLI as it is less efficient compared to the desktop app. Always opt for the desktop app for a cleaner and more powerful experience.

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Test Email Automation**: Send a test email and verify that Codex correctly summarizes and drafts a reply.
2. **Validate SaaS App**: Ensure that your SaaS app correctly displays maintenance activities and integrates with GitHub or Linear.
3. **Evaluate Model Training**: Test your custom model on a small dataset to ensure it performs as expected.

For more detailed validation steps, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
