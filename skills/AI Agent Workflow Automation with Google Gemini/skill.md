# AI Agent Workflow Automation with Google Gemini

## Overview
This skill enables you to implement autonomous AI agents using Google Gemini's Spark feature. These agents can handle complex workflows by breaking them into parallelizable sub-tasks, process multimodal inputs through the Omni model, and execute scheduled actions via heartbeats. Key capabilities include:
- Autonomous task execution with sub-agent coordination
- Multimodal (text+image+video) processing and generation
- Context-aware desktop integration with speech filtering
- Recurring task automation

For foundational concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Agent Initialization**
   - Access Spark through the Gemini app's beta features
   - Define your primary task objective (e.g., "Prepare my daily work briefing")
   - Specify whether the task should recur (set heartbeat parameters)

2. **Task Decomposition**
   - Let the agent automatically determine sub-tasks or manually specify them
   - Example for daily briefing:
     1. Check calendar appointments
     2. Scan unread emails
     3. Review task list
     4. Compile weather/commute info

3. **Multimodal Processing**
   - When working with mixed media:
     1. Upload all source files
     2. Provide clear instructions for how to combine them
     3. Specify output format requirements
   - Detailed examples in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)

4. **Execution Monitoring**
   - Review the agent's proposed action plan before execution
   - Monitor initial runs to verify:
     - All sub-tasks are completed
     - Output quality meets expectations
     - Timing aligns with requirements

5. **Optimization**
   - Refine prompts based on initial results
   - Add conditional logic where needed
   - Adjust scheduling as necessary

## Best Practices
1. **Prompt Design**
   - Be specific about desired outcomes
   - Include examples when possible
   - For complex tasks, break instructions into logical sections

2. **Error Handling**
   - Anticipate common failure points:
     - Missing context
     - Ambiguous instructions
     - Media format incompatibilities
   - Build in verification steps for critical tasks

3. **Security**
   - Limit agent access to sensitive data
   - Review actions before execution in high-stakes scenarios
   - More implementation guidance in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md)

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Overly Broad Tasks**
   - Bad: "Manage my entire workday"
   - Good: "Prepare a prioritized task list based on today's calendar"

2. **Ignoring Context Limits**
   - Agents may lose track in very long conversations
   - Solution: Break extremely complex workflows into separate agent instances

3. **Scheduling Conflicts**
   - Heartbeats may overlap with system maintenance
   - Solution: Stagger execution times for multiple agents

## Validation Steps
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all sub-tasks complete successfully
   - Check output quality against requirements

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure execution time for time-sensitive workflows
   - Test with peak loads (e.g., processing many emails)

3. **User Acceptance**
   - Have end-users review outputs
   - Adjust based on feedback

## Implementation Example
```python
# Sample workflow for content creation agent
content_agent = {
    "trigger": "when new blog topic requested",
    "steps": [
        "Research trending subtopics",
        "Draft outline with 3 main sections",
        "Generate 2 supporting images per section",
        "Compile into Google Doc with headers"
    ],
    "output": {
        "format": "Google Doc",
        "review_required": True
    }
}
```
