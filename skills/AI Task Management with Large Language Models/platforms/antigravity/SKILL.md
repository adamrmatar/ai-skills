# AI Task Management with Large Models

## Overview
This skill enables you to effectively delegate complex, high-value tasks to large language models (LLMs) by:
1. Identifying tasks suited for models like Fable 5 ([Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md))
2. Preparing comprehensive input packages ([Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md))
3. Implementing robust validation workflows ([Code Examples](references/code_examples.md))

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Task Identification**
   - List pain points that consume disproportionate time
   - Filter for tasks with:
     - Clear success criteria
     - Available source data
     - Low creative judgment requirements

2. **Economic Assessment**
   - Estimate token costs using model pricing
   - Compare against human labor hours
   - Only proceed if ROI > 3:1

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Gather all source materials
   - Annotate with context notes
   - Structure for model comprehension:
     ```python
     # From [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)
     input_package = {
         "sources": [
             {"type": "csv", "description": "Q2 customer exports"},
             {"type": "pdf", "description": "Product specs v2.3"}
         ],
         "special_instructions": "Ignore draft watermarks"
     }
     ```

4. **Task Specification**
   - Define success criteria quantitatively
   - Specify review protocols
   - Set runtime constraints

5. **Execution**
   - Submit full package to model
   - Resist hovering during processing
   - Monitor for system alerts only

6. **Validation**
   - Apply predefined checks
   - Sample outputs thoroughly
   - Document all revisions required

## Best Practices
- **Think in Weeks Saved**: Target tasks that would take humans 2+ weeks
- **Pre-Process Data**: Spend 10-20% of expected savings time preparing inputs
- **Version Control**: Maintain copies of all inputs/outputs for audit trails
- **Model Steering**: Provide style guides, previous examples, and rubrics

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Under-Scoping**: 
   - *Bad*: "Improve this email" 
   - *Good*: "Audit all client comms from Q2 for compliance gaps"
2. **Over-Supervision**: 
   - Interrupting model processing wastes resources
3. **Vague Criteria**: 
   - "Make it better" → Unverifiable
   - "Reduce word count by 15% while keeping all key terms" → Measurable

## Validation Framework
1. **Automated Checks**:
   - Scripted validation of structured outputs
   - Statistical sampling of decisions
2. **Human Review**:
   - Spot-check nuanced judgments
   - Validate edge case handling
3. **Process Audit**:
   - Verify all input data was processed
   - Confirm no silent failures occurred

## Implementation Notes
- Start with 1-2 high-impact tasks weekly
- Document lessons after each project
- Gradually increase complexity as trust builds
- Combine with traditional automation for hybrid workflows
