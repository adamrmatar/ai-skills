# AI Agent Skills Integration

## Overview
This skill enables AI agents to integrate and utilize a variety of pre-built skills and plugins to enhance their capabilities. These skills range from design and research to code review and animation generation. The core concept revolves around reusable instruction files (skills) and bundled functionalities (plugins) that provide consistent, repeatable behaviors.

For a deeper dive into the core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Identify the Skill/Plugin**: Determine the functionality you need (e.g., design, research, code review).
2. **Install the Skill/Plugin**: Use the GitHub URL to install the skill/plugin in your AI harness (e.g., CodeX, Claude Code).
   ```
   install this for me, please <GitHub_URL>
   ```
3. **Activate the Skill**: Use the appropriate command to activate the skill (e.g., `/graphify`, `/understand`).
4. **Provide Input**: Give the necessary input or prompt to the skill (e.g., a paragraph to improve, a codebase to review).
5. **Review Output**: Analyze the output and iterate if necessary.

For detailed installation and usage examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code/Prompt Templates
### Installing a Skill
```
install this for me, please https://github.com/garytan/gstack
```
### Using the Stop Slop Skill
```
use the Stop Slop skill to improve this paragraph: <paste_paragraph_here>
```
### Using the Graphify Skill
```
/graphify .
```

For more code examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic skills like Stop Slop before moving to complex ones like Graphify.
- **Validate Outputs**: Always review the outputs for accuracy and relevance.
- **Combine Skills**: Some skills work better when combined (e.g., front-end design and taste skills).

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overloading Tokens**: Complex skills like Graphify can be token-heavy. Monitor usage.
- **Skill Conflicts**: Combining incompatible skills can lead to suboptimal results (e.g., mixing design skills without clear objectives).

## Validation and Testing
1. **Test in Isolation**: Use each skill individually to understand its capabilities.
2. **Compare Outputs**: Run the same prompt with different skills to compare results.
3. **Iterate**: Refine prompts and inputs based on initial outputs.

For a comprehensive list of pitfalls and how to avoid them, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Reconcile Differences
- **Design Skills**: The front-end design skill (Anthropic) and taste skill (Leon XLNX) serve similar purposes but produce different outputs. Test both to determine which suits your needs.
- **Animation Skills**: Remotion and Hyperframes both generate animations but with varying quality. Hyperframes generally produces more polished results.
