# AI-Driven Sales and Marketing LTV Optimization

## Overview
This skill focuses on implementing a three-layered architecture for AI-driven sales and marketing, as detailed in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md). The architecture includes Signal Layer, Buyer Intelligence Layer, and Action Layer, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the buyer and personalized engagement.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Signal Layer**: Capture and enrich signals from CRM systems, social media platforms, and anonymous visitors. Use tools like LinkedIn for job changes and engagement signals.
2. **Buyer Intelligence Layer**: Utilize a knowledge base to store context about products, buyers, ICPs, personas, and success criteria. Implement ICP scoring and context building.
3. **Action Layer**: Personalize engagement by identifying users, addressing them by name, and offering specific content based on intent signals. Update CRM and trigger outreach sequences.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Enriching Signals
from enrich_signals import EnrichSignals

enricher = EnrichSignals()
enriched_data = enricher.enrich_from_crm(crm_data)
enriched_data = enricher.enrich_from_social_media(social_media_data)

# Example: Personalized Engagement Prompt
prompt = "Hello {name}, welcome back! Last time we discussed {topic}. Would you like to continue where we left off?"
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update the knowledge base with closed-won and closed-lost opportunities to retrain models. Use context graphs to prioritize high-intent accounts.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid alert fatigue by focusing on relevant alerts. Ensure the system minimizes friction in the approval queue to maintain trust.

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. Verify signal enrichment accuracy by comparing enriched data with known CRM records.
2. Test personalized engagement prompts with a sample of users to ensure relevance and effectiveness.
3. Monitor CRM updates and outreach sequences to confirm they align with buyer intelligence.
