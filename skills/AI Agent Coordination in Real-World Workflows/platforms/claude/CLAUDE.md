# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Ai Agent Coordination In Real World Workflows
> A skill for designing and implementing AI agents that effectively coordinate across multiple systems while adhering to policies, managing exceptions, and maintaining human oversight in real-world workflows.

# AI Agent Coordination Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to design AI agents that effectively coordinate complex workflows across multiple systems while maintaining policy compliance and human oversight. Key concepts are covered in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Workflow Analysis**
   - Document all steps, systems, and decision points
   - Identify policy touchpoints and exception scenarios

2. **System Integration Setup**
   - Establish API connections to all involved systems
   - Implement state tracking mechanisms
   - Create reconciliation processes

3. **Policy Implementation**
   - Encode business rules in machine-executable format
   - Build escalation pathways for edge cases
   - See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for details

4. **Orchestration Logic**
   - Sequence actions with proper dependencies
   - Implement monitoring for long-running workflows
   - Use patterns from [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md)

5. **Exception Handling**
   - Define detection criteria for common exceptions
   - Route exceptions with proper context to humans
   - Log all automated handling decisions

6. **Validation & Monitoring**
   - Test with historical workflow data
   - Measure time savings vs exception rates
   - Audit policy application accuracy

## Best Practices
- **Start Small**: Begin with the most predictable sub-workflow
- **Maintain State**: Always track workflow progress across systems
- **Clear Handoffs**: Humans should receive problems with suggested actions
- **Audit Trails**: Log all automated decisions with rationale

## Common Pitfalls
- **Over-Automation**: Attempting to handle too many exception cases
- **Brittle Integration**: Failing to handle system unavailability
- **Policy Gaps**: Not accounting for all real-world constraints
- **Black Box**: Not explaining automated decisions to humans

## Validation Steps
1. **Unit Testing**: Verify each policy rule independently
2. **Integration Testing**: Run complete workflows with test data
3. **Shadow Testing**: Run parallel to human operators
4. **Exception Simulation**: Artificially trigger edge cases
5. **Performance Testing**: Verify under peak load conditions

# Detailed Guidelines

## Code Examples

# Code Examples for Agent Coordination

## Workflow Orchestration Template
```python
def coordinate_onboarding(employee_data):
    """Orchestrates new employee onboarding workflow"""
    # Validate input against policy
    if not validate_policies(employee_data):
        return escalate_to_hr(employee_data)
    
    # Sequence system interactions
    try:
        create_it_account(employee_data)
        schedule_training(employee_data)
        order_equipment(employee_data)
        
        # Monitor completion
        while not all_tasks_complete():
            check_exceptions()
            time.sleep(3600)  # Check hourly
            
    except Exception as e:
        handle_workflow_exception(e)
        return False
    
    return True
```

## Policy Evaluation Snippet
```python
def evaluate_request(request):
    """Applies policy rules to incoming requests"""
    # Simple rules engine
    if request['type'] == 'password_reset':
        if verify_ownership(request):
            return {'action': 'auto_approve'}
        
    if request['cost'] > get_approval_threshold(request['department']):
        return {'action': 'escalate', 'level': 'manager'}
    
    # Default case
    return {'action': 'route', 'queue': 'standard_review'}
```

## Exception Handling Pattern
```python
def process_invoice(invoice):
    """Handles both standard and exception cases"""
    try:
        extracted = extract_data(invoice)
        if not validate_invoice(extracted):
            raise InvoiceException('Validation failed')
            
        post_to_erp(extracted)
        
    except InvoiceException as e:
        # Route to human with context
        human_review_queue.add(
            invoice=invoice,
            error=str(e),
            suggested_action='verify_amounts'
        )
        return False
```

## Core Concepts

# Core Concepts of AI Agent Coordination

Effective AI agent coordination in real-world systems revolves around four key principles:

1. **System Orchestration**: Agents must manage sequences of actions across multiple disparate systems. For example, in employee onboarding, this involves coordinating between HR systems, IT provisioning, training platforms, and scheduling tools.

2. **Policy Governance**: Every action must be evaluated against organizational policies. In IT support scenarios, this means automatically handling low-risk password resets while escalating hardware requests that require budget approval.

3. **Exception Management**: The true test of an agent is handling deviations from the 'happy path'. In invoice processing, this means detecting and routing mismatched amounts or missing PO numbers for human review while automatically processing standard invoices.

4. **Human Oversight**: Agents should have clearly defined handoff points where human judgment is required. This includes both planned handoffs (like approval steps) and unplanned ones (when confidence thresholds aren't met).

Successful implementations share these characteristics:
- Narrow scope focused on specific workflows
- Tight integration with existing systems
- Clear escalation pathways
- Audit trails for all automated actions

These agents don't replace humans but rather extend their capabilities by handling routine coordination at scale while ensuring policy compliance.

## Practical Guide

# Practical Guide to Implementing Coordinated Agents

## Workflow Design
1. **Map the Current Process**: Document all steps, systems, decision points, and exceptions in the existing workflow. For onboarding, this would include:
   - HR system triggers
   - IT provisioning dependencies
   - Training completion tracking

2. **Identify Automation Boundaries**: Determine which steps can be fully automated (e.g., creating standard accounts) versus those needing human review (e.g., special access requests).

3. **Define Policy Rules**: Create machine-readable representations of all relevant policies. Example for IT support:
```
IF request_type == 'password_reset' AND requester == account_owner
THEN auto_approve
ELSE IF request_value > 1000
THEN route_to_manager
```

## System Integration
- Use APIs with idempotent operations for system interactions
- Implement state tracking to resume interrupted workflows
- Build reconciliation processes for when systems get out of sync

## Monitoring
- Track time spent in automated vs manual states
- Measure exception rates by type
- Audit policy application decisions

## Iterative Improvement
- Start with the most predictable sub-workflows
- Gradually expand scope as confidence increases
- Maintain human override capabilities at all stages
