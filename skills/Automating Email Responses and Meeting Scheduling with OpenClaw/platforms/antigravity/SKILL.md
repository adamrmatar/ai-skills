### Overview
OpenClaw is a digital assistant that can perform tasks end-to-end, such as reading and responding to emails, scheduling meetings, and connecting to various tools. This skill focuses on setting up OpenClaw on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), configuring it to interact with Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and automating workflows for responding to sponsorship emails and scheduling meetings.

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up OpenClaw on a VPS**
   - Choose a VPS provider (e.g., Hostinger).
   - Select a plan (e.g., KVM 2) and apply any available discounts.
   - Complete the setup process by providing necessary details and payment information.

2. **Configure OpenClaw**
   - Access the OpenClaw interface and complete the initial setup by answering bootstrap questions (e.g., defining the agent's personality).
   - Configure integrations with Telegram by creating a bot via BotFather and linking it to OpenClaw.

3. **Integrate Gmail**
   - Enable two-factor authentication on your Google account.
   - Generate an app password for OpenClaw.
   - Connect OpenClaw to Gmail using the app password.

4. **Integrate Google Drive**
   - Create an OAuth client ID for Google Drive.
   - Download the JSON file and provide it to OpenClaw.
   - Authorize OpenClaw to access Google Drive.

5. **Automate Email Responses**
   - Define a workflow in OpenClaw to read sponsorship emails, decline offers from conflicting companies, and send media kits to interested parties.
   - Schedule this workflow to run daily using cron jobs.

6. **Integrate Google Calendar**
   - Enable the Google Calendar API.
   - Authenticate OpenClaw to access Google Calendar.

7. **Automate Meeting Scheduling**
   - Use Telegram to command OpenClaw to schedule meetings.
   - Specify meeting details (e.g., participant, time slot, agenda).
   - Verify that the meeting is correctly scheduled in Google Calendar.

### Best Practices
- Use a VPS for easier setup and maintenance.
- Regularly update and monitor cron jobs to ensure workflows run smoothly.
- Test integrations thoroughly before relying on them for critical tasks.

### Common Pitfalls
