# Automating Email Responses and Meeting Scheduling with OpenClaw

## Overview
OpenClaw is a digital assistant that automates tasks like email responses and meeting scheduling. This skill covers setting up OpenClaw on a VPS, integrating it with Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and creating autonomous workflows. For core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up OpenClaw on a VPS**:
   - Choose a VPS provider (e.g., Hostinger) and deploy OpenClaw using the one-click setup.
   - Configure initial settings, including the assistant's personality and communication channels (Telegram/WhatsApp).

2. **Integrate Gmail**:
   - Enable two-factor authentication and generate an app password.
   - Provide the email and password to OpenClaw for authentication.

3. **Integrate Google Drive**:
   - Create an OAuth client ID and download the JSON file.
   - Provide the JSON file to OpenClaw and authorize access.

4. **Integrate Google Calendar**:
   - Enable the Google Calendar API and authenticate OpenClaw.
   - Test by scheduling a meeting via Telegram.

5. **Create Autonomous Workflows**:
   - Set up cron jobs for daily email checks and responses.
   - Use natural language commands to automate tasks (e.g., "Schedule a meeting with Karan tomorrow").

For detailed steps, refer to the [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

Schedule a meeting with Karandeep tomorrow for a discussion on the Boston project. Pick any 30-minute time between 9:00 to 12:00 noon.
```
More examples can be found in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use a VPS for easier setup and maintenance.
  - Interact with OpenClaw using natural language.
  - Monitor tool calls to understand and troubleshoot workflows.

- **Pitfalls**:
  - Avoid local setup due to complexity and security risks.
  - Double-check authentication settings to prevent errors.
  - Handle broken links during integration by pasting them back to OpenClaw.

For more details, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
1. **Test Email Automation**:
   - Send a test sponsorship email and verify OpenClaw's response.
   - Check the sent folder to ensure the response and attachments are correct.

2. **Test Meeting Scheduling**:
   - Schedule a test meeting via Telegram and verify it appears in Google Calendar.
   - Confirm the meeting details (time, participants) are accurate.

3. **Test Cron Jobs**:
   - Verify the cron job is set up correctly and runs at the specified time.
   - Check logs to ensure the job executes as expected.

By following these steps, you can ensure OpenClaw is functioning correctly and efficiently automating your tasks.
