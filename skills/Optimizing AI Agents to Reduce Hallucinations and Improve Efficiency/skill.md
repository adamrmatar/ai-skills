### Overview
AI agents often hallucinate or waste tokens due to inefficient tool selection, unstructured data retrieval, and lack of validation mechanisms. This skill introduces five techniques to address these issues:
1. **Semantic Tool Selection**: Filters tools based on relevance to reduce token usage.
2. **GraphRAG**: Replaces text retrieval with structured graph queries for precise answers.
3. **Multi-Agent Validation**: Adds a validation layer to catch errors before responses reach users.
4. **Neuro-Symbolic Guardians**: Enforces rules in code to prevent agents from bypassing constraints.
5. **Runtime Guardians**: Allows agents to self-correct and complete tasks without hard stops.

For detailed explanations of each technique, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Semantic Tool Selection**:
   - Create a vector database of tools.
   - Use semantic search to filter relevant tools for each query.
   - Reduce token usage by sending only the most relevant tools.
   Example: [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

2. **GraphRAG**:
   - Build a knowledge graph from documents.
   - Use Cypher queries to retrieve structured data.
   - Replace text retrieval with graph queries for precise answers.
   Example: [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

3. **Multi-Agent Validation**:
   - Implement a swarm of agents: executor, validator, and critic.
   - Validate responses before they reach users.
   - Catch hallucinations and errors early.
   Example: [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

4. **Neuro-Symbolic Guardians**:
   - Write rules in Python code using hooks.
   - Intercept tool calls to enforce constraints.
   - Prevent agents from bypassing rules.
   Example: [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

5. **Runtime Guardians**:
   - Use agent control to steer agents when rules are soft.
   - Allow agents to self-correct and complete tasks.
   - Avoid hard stops and improve user experience.
   Example: [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

### Best Practices
- **Semantic Tool Selection**: Always filter tools based on relevance to minimize token usage.
- **GraphRAG**: Use structured queries for precise answers, especially for aggregations and counts.
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Implement a validation layer to catch errors before responses reach users.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Guardians**: Enforce rules in code, not in prompts, to ensure compliance.
- **Runtime Guardians**: Use steering rules to allow agents to self-correct and complete tasks.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Semantic Tool Selection**: Sending all tools in every query wastes tokens and increases costs.
- **GraphRAG**: Relying on text retrieval for structured queries leads to inaccurate answers.
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Single agents may generate false success responses without validation.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Guardians**: Rules in prompts are suggestions, not constraints.
- **Runtime Guardians**: Hard stops can frustrate users; use steering rules instead.

### Validation and Testing
- **Semantic Tool Selection**: Compare token usage and accuracy before and after filtering tools.
- **GraphRAG**: Test queries for aggregations and counts to ensure precise answers.
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Compare responses from single agents and swarms to catch hallucinations.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Guardians**: Test rule enforcement by attempting to bypass constraints.
- **Runtime Guardians**: Verify that agents self-correct and complete tasks without hard stops.
