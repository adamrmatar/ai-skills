## Overview
This skill guides AI agents through a structured software development workflow, from initial planning to final implementation and code review. The workflow includes steps for creating specifications, breaking down tasks into tickets, implementing features, and reviewing code for quality and adherence to standards.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Grill the User**: Start by grilling the user to gather detailed requirements. Use the `grill_me` skill to ask one question at a time and ensure a shared understanding before proceeding.
2. **Create Specifications**: Convert the gathered requirements into a detailed specification using the `to_spec` skill. This document should outline the technical and non-technical aspects of the project.
3. **Break Down Tasks**: Use the `to_tickets` skill to break down the specification into individual tickets. Each ticket should represent a manageable task that can be completed in a single agent session.
4. **Implement Features**: Implement each ticket using the `implement` skill. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices where possible and run type checking and tests regularly.
5. **Code Review**: Review the implemented code using the `code_review` skill. Check for adherence to coding standards and ensure the code faithfully implements the originating specification.
6. **Commit Work**: Once the code review is complete, commit the work to the current branch.

## Code Snippets
```javascript
// Example of using the implement skill
const implementSkill = require('skills/implement');
implementSkill.execute({
  spec: 'path/to/spec.md',
  ticket: 'path/to/ticket.md',
  tdd: true,
  typeChecking: true,
  testSuite: true
});
```

## Best Practices
- **Ask One Question at a Time**: Avoid overwhelming the user with multiple questions simultaneously.
- **Use TDD**: Implement features using Test-Driven Development to ensure code quality.
- **Regular Type Checking**: Run type checking regularly to catch errors early.
- **Full Test Suite**: Run the full test suite at the end of the implementation to ensure all tests pass.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Multiple Questions**: Asking multiple questions at once can confuse the user and lead to incomplete or incorrect requirements.
- **Skipping Code Review**: Skipping the code review step can result in code that does not adhere to standards or fully implement the specification.
- **Ignoring TDD**: Not using TDD can lead to poorly tested code and increased technical debt.

## Validation and Testing
- **Shared Understanding**: Ensure the user confirms a shared understanding before proceeding with implementation.
- **Code Standards**: Verify that the code adheres to the repository's documented coding standards.
- **Specification Adherence**: Check that the code faithfully implements the originating specification.
