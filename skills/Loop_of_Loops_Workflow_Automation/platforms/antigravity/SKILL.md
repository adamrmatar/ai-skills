  Automate recurring tasks by creating interconnected loops that manage workflows, share context, and reduce mental load.

## Overview

A Loop of Loops is a system where multiple recurring tasks (loops) are interconnected to manage workflows efficiently. Each loop handles a specific task, shares context with other loops, and stops when boundaries are met. This approach reduces the need for constant prompting and manual intervention.

### Core Concepts

- **Prompt**: A single request to AI.
- **Loop**: A recurring task with memory.
- **Loop of Loops**: Multiple loops that notice each other, share context, and stop when boundaries are met.

For more details, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify Recurring Tasks**: Identify tasks that recur frequently and require similar steps each time.
2. **Define Each Loop**: Define the steps and memory requirements for each loop.
3. **Interconnect Loops**: Set up communication between loops so they can share context and trigger each other.
4. **Set Boundaries**: Define stopping conditions for each loop.
5. **Implement and Test**: Implement the loops and test their functionality.

For a practical guide, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example: Packing List Loop
packing_list_loop = {
    'trigger': 'school_trip_email',
    'steps': [
        'check_weather',
        'check_inventory',
        'generate_list',
        'buy_missing_items'
    ],
    'memory': ['previous_packing_lists', 'current_inventory']
}
```

For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with a single loop before moving to interconnected loops.
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define clear stopping conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- **Context Sharing**: Ensure loops can share context effectively.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overcomplication**: Avoid making loops too complex initially.
- **Lack of Boundaries**: Ensure each loop has clear stopping conditions.
- **Poor Context Sharing**: Ensure loops can share context effectively.

For more on pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each loop individually.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test how loops interact with each other.
3. **Boundary Testing**: Ensure loops stop when boundaries are met.
