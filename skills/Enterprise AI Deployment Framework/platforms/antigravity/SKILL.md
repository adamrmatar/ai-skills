# Enterprise AI Deployment Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach to deploying AI agents in enterprise environments, addressing the critical gaps observed in production deployments: observability, evaluation, and governance. The methodology has been battle-tested across regulated industries like financial services.

Key benefits:
- Reduces failed POCs by focusing on measurable outcomes first
- Enables debugging of complex agent behaviors in production
- Maintains compliance with regulatory requirements
- Scales from single agents to complex multi-agent systems

For foundational concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Define Evaluation Framework**
   - Identify 3-5 key business metrics (e.g., deflection rate, accuracy)
   - Build initial test case library with 200+ real-world examples
   - Implement automated evaluation pipeline (see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for details)

2. **Implement Observability**
   - Instrument agents to capture:
     ```python
     # Example tracing decorator
     def trace_agent_call(func):
         def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
             start_time = time.time()
             result = func(*args, **kwargs)
             end_time = time.time()
             
             log_entry = {
                 'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
                 'operation': func.__name__,
                 'duration': end_time - start_time,
                 'inputs': kwargs,
                 'outputs': result
             }
             tracing_db.insert(log_entry)
             return result
         return wrapper
     ```
   - Set up dashboards for key metrics

3. **Establish Data Foundation**
   - Create separate strategies for:
     - Question data (RAG sources, APIs)
     - Tracking data (observability logs)
   - Implement data quality checks:
     ```python
     # Example data quality check
     def validate_policy_document(doc):
         required_fields = ['effective_date', 'policy_id', 'content']
         if not all(field in doc for field in required_fields):
             raise ValueError('Invalid policy document structure')
         if doc['effective_date'] < datetime.now().date():
             raise ValueError('Policy document expired')
     ```

4. **Design Orchestration**
   - Select pattern based on use case complexity:
     - Orchestrator-worker for centralized control
     - Choreography for independent agents
     - Human-in-loop for high-risk decisions

5. **Implement Governance**
   - Follow the [Governance Checklist](references/governance_checklist.md)
   - Establish:
     - Prompt version control
     - Model change management
     - Incident response playbook

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Evaluation**
   - Case Study: Banking chatbot selected model in week 7/8 after establishing evaluation framework
   - Avoids endless model debates by focusing on measurable outcomes

2. **Treat Test Cases as Living System**
   - Continuously add new cases from production incidents
   - Categorize cases by problem type for easier maintenance

3. **Monitor Behavioral Patterns**
   - Example: Detected duplicate API calls increasing costs
   - Implement checks for:
     - Excessive retries
     - Circular agent dependencies
     - Stale data access

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Premature Model Selection**
   - Mistake: Choosing model before defining success criteria
   - Result: Inability to properly evaluate alternatives

2. **Insufficient Tracing**
   - Mistake: Only logging final responses
   - Result: Can't debug why agents made specific decisions

3. **Static Test Cases**
   - Mistake: Not updating evaluation data set
   - Result: Misses new failure patterns in production

## Validation Steps

1. **Pre-Production Testing**
   - Run full evaluation suite against new deployments
   - Verify all tracing data is captured correctly
   - Test failure modes and recovery procedures

2. **Production Monitoring**
   - Daily review of key metrics
   - Weekly analysis of evaluation results
   - Monthly governance audits

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Add new test cases for each production incident
   - Regularly review and prune evaluation data set
   - Update governance policies based on new regulations
