## Overview
This skill teaches you how to integrate AI agents into your development workflow using CLI tools, custom agents, and guardrails. The goal is to scale your productivity by delegating repetitive tasks and focusing on higher-level system design. Learn more in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Start with the CLI**: Use the CLI as your entry point for managing tasks like GitHub issues, PRs, and status checks. This reduces the need to open an editor for every task.
2. **Set Up Guardrails**: Create an `Agents.md` file in your repository to define high-level guidance, application architecture, and constraints. This ensures agents adhere to your project's intent.
3. **Create Custom Agents**: Define custom agents with specific roles (e.g., security expert, backend developer) and equip them with tools and skills. Learn more in [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
4. **Delegate Tasks**: Use the CLI or GitHub UI to delegate tasks like feature development or bug fixes. Agents will create draft PRs for your review.
5. **Fine-Tune in the Editor**: Use the editor for fine adjustments and final reviews, leveraging AI tools for assistance.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```bash
# Example CLI command to delegate a task
copilot delegate "Create a finance app that tracks my spending. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
```
```markdown
# Example Agents.md content
## Project Overview
This project is a finance tracker built with React and Tailwind.
## Agent Responsibilities
- Do not change the architecture without explicit approval.
- Follow coding standards defined in the repository.
```

## Best Practices
- **Use Guardrails**: Always define constraints in `Agents.md` to prevent agents from making unauthorized changes.
- **Delegate Wisely**: Delegate repetitive tasks but keep humans in the loop for final approvals.
- **Leverage Skills**: Create reusable skills for common tasks to ensure consistency.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Lack of Guardrails**: Without constraints, agents may produce incorrect or unwanted results.
- **Over-Delegation**: Delegating too much without oversight can lead to chaos. Always review draft PRs.

## Validation and Testing
- **Test Guardrails**: Verify that agents adhere to the constraints defined in `Agents.md`.
- **Review Draft PRs**: Check the quality and correctness of draft PRs created by agents.
- **Monitor Agent Behavior**: Ensure agents are performing tasks as expected and not deviating from their roles.
