# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Claude Cowork System Setup
> A comprehensive skill for setting up and managing a Claude Cowork system, enabling persistent memory, context-aware responses, and efficient task management.

## Overview

The Claude Cowork system is a structured approach to leveraging AI for task management, persistent memory, and context-aware responses. By organizing your workspace with markdown files (`claude.md`, `memory.md`, and `voice_principles.md`), you can create a system that remembers past interactions, maintains your tone of voice, and efficiently manages tasks. This skill will guide you through setting up this system, including creating the necessary files, organizing your workspace, and optimizing for low token usage.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Create the Root Folder**: Start by creating a folder named `Co-work OS` in your documents.
2. **Download Starter Templates**: Download the `claude.md`, `memory.md`, and `voice_principles.md` templates provided in the transcript.
3. **Organize Files**: Place `claude.md` and `memory.md` in the root folder. Create a `00_resources` folder and move `voice_principles.md` into it.
4. **Set Up Obsidian**: Install Obsidian and open the `Co-work OS` folder as a vault to view the markdown files in a readable format.
5. **Configure `claude.md`**: Ensure `claude.md` includes instructions to read `memory.md` at the start of each session and to write to `memory.md` when told to remember something.
6. **Build Workstations**: Create workstation folders (e.g., `email HQ`, `personal finances`) each with their own `claude.md`, `memory.md`, and `resources` folder.
7. **Optimize Token Usage**: Keep the root `claude.md` file lean by pointing to other resource files only when necessary.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

### Prompt Template for Voice Principles
```markdown
Option 1: Gmail Connected
Paste this prompt into a new session within Co-work:
"Extract writing patterns from my last 30 sent emails to build my voice profile."

Option 2: No Gmail Connected
Paste this prompt into a new session within Co-work:
"Analyze these five writing samples to build my voice profile."
```

### Session Audit Prompt
```markdown
{forward slash} session audit
```

For more examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices
- **Keep Files Lean**: Avoid repeating rules in multiple files to reduce token usage.
- **Use Sonnet Model**: Default to the Sonnet model for most tasks to save costs.
- **Session Audits**: Regularly audit sessions to capture unsaved principles and preferences.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Overloading Root File**: Avoid adding too many rules to the root `claude.md` file, as it is loaded by default in every session.
- **Misclassification**: Correct any misclassifications (e.g., categorizing Canva as freelancer instead of software) to ensure accurate future classifications.

For more best practices and pitfalls, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Test Memory**: Start a new session and ask Co-work about recent entries in `memory.md` to verify persistence.
2. **Check Voice Principles**: Review the `voice_principles.md` file to ensure it accurately reflects your tone of voice.
3. **Workstation Functionality**: Test workstation-specific tasks (e.g., drafting emails) to ensure rules are correctly applied.

The Claude Cowork system revolves around three core concepts: persistent memory, context-aware responses, and efficient task management. Persistent memory is achieved through the `memory.md` file, which stores information between sessions. Context-aware responses are enabled by the `claude.md` file, which acts as the instruction manual for Co-work. Efficient task management is facilitated by organizing workstations, each with its own set of rules and resources.

### Persistent Memory
The `memory.md` file is crucial for maintaining continuity between sessions. It contains sections for active projects and general memory entries. When you tell Co-work to remember something, it writes that information to `memory.md`, ensuring it can be recalled in future sessions.

### Context-Aware Responses
The `claude.md` file governs how Co-work behaves. It includes instructions for reading `memory.md` at the start of each session and for routing tasks to the appropriate workstation. This ensures that Co-work always has the necessary context to provide relevant responses.

### Efficient Task Management
Workstations are specialized folders that handle specific areas of your life (e.g., email, personal finances). Each workstation has its own `claude.md`, `memory.md`, and `resources` folder, allowing for task-specific rules and resources. This modular approach keeps the system organized and efficient.
