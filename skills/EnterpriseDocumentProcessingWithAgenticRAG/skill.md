## Overview
This skill enables you to process and query enterprise documents using Agentic RAG workflows. Unlike traditional RAG solutions, Agentic RAG incorporates verification, orchestration, and enterprise control, ensuring reliable and secure data handling. For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Upload Private Data**: Begin by uploading your enterprise documents (PDFs, videos, PowerPoint decks) to the system.
2. **Build Knowledge Box**: Organize the uploaded data into a structured knowledge box.
3. **Select Model**: Choose a language model (e.g., GPT, Claude) for processing.
4. **Deploy Agents**: Utilize agent-driven workflows to ground and verify responses.
5. **Data Augmentation**: Employ data augmentation agents to enrich and extract relationships from the content.
6. **Test Search**: Validate the search functionality to ensure accurate retrieval.
7. **Tune Configuration**: Adjust system settings for optimal performance.
8. **Track Metrics**: Monitor performance metrics to assess system effectiveness.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example: Uploading documents
from agentic_rag import DocumentUploader
uploader = DocumentUploader()
uploader.upload('path/to/document.pdf')
```

## Best Practices
- **Data Verification**: Always verify the integrity of uploaded documents.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a model that best fits your enterprise needs.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly track performance metrics to identify and address issues promptly.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Lack of Verification**: Skipping verification can lead to inaccurate responses.
- **Poor Model Fit**: Selecting an inappropriate model can degrade system performance.

## Validation and Testing
- **Search Testing**: Perform extensive search tests to ensure accurate document retrieval.
- **Configuration Tuning**: Continuously tune system configurations based on performance metrics.
