# Claude Connectors Integration Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to connect Claude to external services for enhanced automation capabilities. See [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) for foundational knowledge.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Access Connectors Menu**
   - Click profile icon → Customize → Connectors

2. **Select Service to Connect**
   - Choose from available options (Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
   - For extended options, select Zapier MCP

3. **Authenticate Service**
   - Follow OAuth flow for each service
   - Example Gmail auth prompt:
     ```
     [Gmail Authentication]
     Please log in to your Google account to continue
     Allow Claude to:
     [✓] Read your emails
     [✓] Send emails on your behalf
     ```

4. **Verify Connection**
   - Test with simple query: "Are there any unread emails?"

5. **Begin Automation**
   - Use natural language prompts to interact with connected services
   - Sample prompt template:
     ```
     "Draft a professional response to [email subject] that includes:
     - Acknowledgement of their message
     - Answer to their question about [topic]
     - Availability for follow-up next week"
     ```

## Best Practices
- Start with read-only permissions before granting write access
- Use specific date ranges in calendar queries ("this week" vs "recently")
- For Zapier, pre-configure common workflows in your Zapier account

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-permissioning**: Granting full access when only read is needed
   - Fix: Adjust permissions in service settings
2. **Vague Queries**: "Check my emails" is less effective than "Show unread emails from boss"
3. **Zapier Timeouts**: Complex automations may exceed execution windows
   - Solution: Break into smaller Zaps

## Validation Steps
1. Test basic retrieval ("Show my next meeting")
2. Verify action commands ("Schedule a meeting")
3. Check error handling for:
   - Invalid queries
   - Service outages
   - Permission errors
