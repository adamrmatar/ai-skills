## Overview
LLM Ops is an extension of traditional MLOps, tailored specifically for the unique challenges posed by large language models (LLMs) in production. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs generate open-ended text, require prompt management, and involve complex data flows. This skill will guide you through the essential steps to effectively manage LLMs in production.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Prompt Management**: Version, test, and monitor prompts as part of the system logic.
2. **Data Flow Management**: Integrate embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval logic into the operational system.
3. **Evaluation**: Implement new evaluation strategies such as human feedback, quality scoring, and automated checks.
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor hallucinations, harmful outputs, drift in responses, and user feedback.
5. **Cost Management**: Treat cost as a first-class operational metric, considering token usage, prompt length, and retrieval size.
6. **Security and Compliance**: Implement stricter controls, auditing, and safeguards for sensitive data.

## Code/Prompt Snippets
```python
# Example: Prompt Versioning
prompt_version_1 = "Translate the following English text to French: {text}"
prompt_version_2 = "Convert the following English text to French: {text}"

# Example: Monitoring Hallucinations
monitor_hallucinations(response):
    if "hallucination" in response:
        return "Potential hallucination detected"
    else:
        return "Response is clean"
```

## Best Practices
- **Prompt Management**: Regularly update and test prompts to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Flow**: Ensure data freshness and retrieval quality by regularly updating embeddings and vector databases.
- **Evaluation**: Use a combination of automated checks and human feedback for comprehensive evaluation.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for hallucinations, harmful outputs, and user feedback to maintain system stability.
- **Cost Management**: Optimize token usage and prompt length to control costs.
- **Security**: Implement strict data controls and regular audits to ensure compliance.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Prompt Changes**: Small changes in prompts can significantly alter outputs. Always version and test prompts.
- **Neglecting Data Freshness**: Outdated embeddings and retrieval data can degrade system performance.
- **Overlooking Evaluation**: Relying solely on automated metrics can miss subjective quality aspects.
- **Inadequate Monitoring**: Failing to monitor for hallucinations and harmful outputs can lead to system instability.
- **Cost Overruns**: Not optimizing token usage and prompt length can lead to unexpected costs.
- **Security Lapses**: Sensitive data in prompts and outputs requires strict controls and regular audits.

## Validation and Testing
- **Prompt Testing**: Regularly test prompts with a variety of inputs to ensure consistent outputs.
- **Data Flow Testing**: Validate embeddings and retrieval data for accuracy and freshness.
- **Evaluation Testing**: Use both automated checks and human feedback to validate outputs.
- **Monitoring Validation**: Continuously monitor system outputs and user feedback to detect and address issues promptly.
- **Cost Validation**: Regularly review token usage and prompt length to ensure cost efficiency.
- **Security Validation**: Conduct regular audits and implement strict data controls to ensure compliance.
