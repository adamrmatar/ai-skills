# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Enterprise Level Code Generation And Evaluation With Llms
> A skill for generating enterprise-ready code using LLMs, evaluating its quality, and ensuring it meets security, maintainability, and reliability standards.

## Overview

This skill focuses on generating enterprise-ready code using Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluating its quality to ensure it meets security, maintainability, and reliability standards. The process involves using LLMs to generate code, evaluating the generated code using tools like SonarQube, and iterating on the code to improve its quality.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Generate Code Using LLMs**: Use an LLM to generate code based on your requirements. Ensure the prompt is clear and detailed.

   ```python
   prompt = "Generate a Java method to calculate the factorial of a number."
   generated_code = llm.generate_code(prompt)
   ```

2. **Evaluate Code Quality**: Use SonarQube to evaluate the generated code for security, maintainability, and reliability.

   ```bash
   sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=.
   ```

3. **Analyze Evaluation Results**: Review the evaluation results from SonarQube to identify any issues.

4. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the evaluation results, iterate on the code to improve its quality.

   ```python
   improved_code = llm.improve_code(generated_code, feedback)
   ```

5. **Validate and Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests to ensure the code functions as expected.

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

For practical guidelines and examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Best Practices

- **Clear Prompts**: Ensure your prompts are clear and detailed to generate high-quality code.
- **Regular Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the generated code using tools like SonarQube.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously iterate on the code based on evaluation feedback.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mixed Quality Code**: Be aware that LLMs may generate mixed quality code due to the training data.
- **Security Flaws**: Generated code may contain security flaws inherited from the training data.
- **Verbosity**: Some LLMs may generate verbose code, increasing complexity.

For more on common pitfalls and how to avoid them, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests to validate the functionality of the generated code.
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests to ensure the code works well with other components.
- **Security Tests**: Perform security tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

For detailed validation steps, refer to [Validation Steps](references/validation_steps.md).

# Detailed Guidelines

## Common Pitfalls

# Common Pitfalls

## Mixed Quality Code

LLMs may generate mixed quality code due to the training data. This can lead to inconsistencies and bugs in the generated code.

## Security Flaws

Generated code may contain security flaws inherited from the training data. It's essential to perform security checks to identify and fix these vulnerabilities.

## Verbosity

Some LLMs may generate verbose code, increasing complexity and making it harder to maintain.

## Limited Context

LLMs have limited context and may not understand the company's data, code base, or architecture. This can lead to code that doesn't meet enterprise standards.

For practical guidelines and examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Introduction to LLMs in Code Generation

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development by enabling developers to generate code using natural language prompts. This shift from traditional IDEs to agentic coding platforms has introduced new challenges and opportunities.

## Key Concepts

- **Agentic Coding Platforms**: Platforms like CodeX, Claude, and Devin allow developers to generate code by providing instructions in English.
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Metrics such as security, maintainability, and reliability are crucial for evaluating the quality of generated code.
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Tools like SonarQube provide comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess code quality.

## Importance of Code Quality

Ensuring that generated code meets enterprise standards is essential for maintaining software reliability and security. This involves evaluating code for security flaws, maintainability, and adherence to engineering disciplines.

For practical examples and guidelines, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Generating Code with LLMs

To generate code using LLMs, follow these steps:

1. **Define Clear Prompts**: Ensure your prompts are detailed and specific to generate high-quality code.

   ```python
   prompt = "Generate a Python function to sort a list of integers."
   generated_code = llm.generate_code(prompt)
   ```

2. **Use Evaluation Tools**: Use tools like SonarQube to evaluate the generated code.

   ```bash
   sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=.
   ```

3. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Continuously improve the code based on evaluation feedback.

   ```python
   improved_code = llm.improve_code(generated_code, feedback)
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Regular Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the generated code to identify and fix issues early.
- **Clear Documentation**: Document the generated code to improve maintainability.
- **Security Checks**: Perform security checks to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

For more on common pitfalls and how to avoid them, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

Run integration tests to ensure the code works well with other components.

```bash
mvn integration-test
```

## Security Tests

Perform security tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

```bash
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=.
```

## Code Review

Conduct code reviews to ensure the generated code meets enterprise standards.
