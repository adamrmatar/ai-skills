## Overview

This skill focuses on generating enterprise-ready code using Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluating its quality to ensure it meets security, maintainability, and reliability standards. The process involves using LLMs to generate code, evaluating the generated code using tools like SonarQube, and iterating on the code to improve its quality.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Generate Code Using LLMs**: Use an LLM to generate code based on your requirements. Ensure the prompt is clear and detailed.

   ```python
   prompt = "Generate a Java method to calculate the factorial of a number."
   generated_code = llm.generate_code(prompt)
   ```

2. **Evaluate Code Quality**: Use SonarQube to evaluate the generated code for security, maintainability, and reliability.

   ```bash
   sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=.
   ```

3. **Analyze Evaluation Results**: Review the evaluation results from SonarQube to identify any issues.

4. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the evaluation results, iterate on the code to improve its quality.

   ```python
   improved_code = llm.improve_code(generated_code, feedback)
   ```

5. **Validate and Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests to ensure the code functions as expected.

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

For practical guidelines and examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Best Practices

- **Clear Prompts**: Ensure your prompts are clear and detailed to generate high-quality code.
- **Regular Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the generated code using tools like SonarQube.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously iterate on the code based on evaluation feedback.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mixed Quality Code**: Be aware that LLMs may generate mixed quality code due to the training data.
- **Security Flaws**: Generated code may contain security flaws inherited from the training data.
- **Verbosity**: Some LLMs may generate verbose code, increasing complexity.

For more on common pitfalls and how to avoid them, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests to validate the functionality of the generated code.
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests to ensure the code works well with other components.
- **Security Tests**: Perform security tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
