# Code Comprehension with AI Skill

## Overview

This skill transforms how you understand complex codebases by systemizing AI-assisted comprehension. Based on Priscila Andre de Oliveira's experience at Sentry (a 15+ year old codebase with 100 daily PRs), it focuses on structured exploration rather than just code generation. See [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) for philosophical foundations.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Initialize Context**
   - Provide role, project, and specific needs
   - Example: "I'm a frontend engineer new to the checkout flow"

2. **Select Exploration Mode** (from [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md))
   - Architecture for system overview
   - Convention for style/patterns
   - Feature Trace for implementation details
   - History for change context

3. **Formulate Precise Prompt**
   - Use templates from [Prompt Examples](references/prompt_examples.md)
   - Include format preferences (tables, diagrams)

4. **Verify and Cross-Check**
   - Spot-check against actual code
   - Compare multiple AI responses
   - Consult documentation where available

5. **Iterate with Depth**
   - Drill down from architecture to specifics
   - Chain related questions for comprehensive understanding

6. **Document Insights**
   - Save effective prompts
   - Record learned concepts
   - Share with team members

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize Comprehension**
   - Spend 70% effort understanding, 30% generating (per transcript findings)
   - Never implement without full comprehension

2. **Structure Your Approach**
   - Use the six exploration modes systematically
   - Follow the [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) workflow

3. **Validate Rigorously**
   - Check AI outputs against:
     - Code comments
     - Commit messages
     - Team documentation

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Assuming AI Understands Context**
   - Pitfall: Asking vague questions without boundaries
   - Solution: Provide explicit constraints and examples

2. **Skipping Verification**
   - Pitfall: Trusting AI outputs without spot-checking
   - Solution: Always sample-check against actual code

3. **Generation Over Comprehension**
   - Pitfall: Jumping to code changes without deep understanding
   - Solution: Follow the 70/30 ratio from the transcript

## Validation Steps

1. **Cross-Reference Testing**
   - Ask the same question in different ways
   - Compare responses for consistency

2. **Real-World Verification**
   - Manually verify sample points in code
   - Check against recent PRs/commits

3. **Peer Review**
   - Share AI-generated understanding with teammates
   - Confirm accuracy with domain experts
