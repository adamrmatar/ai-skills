## Overview
AI agent management involves designing and deploying AI systems that can operate autonomously with specific goals, tools, permissions, and memory. This skill is critical as companies increasingly rely on AI to handle workflows, customer support, research, and sales follow-ups. Additionally, deploying local AI models using tools like Ollama or LM Studio is essential for workflows requiring privacy, cost efficiency, or low latency.

For a deeper dive into the core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define the Agent's Purpose**: Clearly outline the agent's goal, such as customer support, research, or sales follow-up.
2. **Equip the Agent with Tools**: Provide the agent with necessary tools, such as APIs, databases, or external services.
3. **Set Permissions and Rules**: Define what the agent is allowed to do and where it needs approval.
4. **Implement Memory and Context**: Ensure the agent can retain and retrieve relevant information.
5. **Deploy Locally (Optional)**: Use tools like Ollama or LM Studio to run the model locally for privacy or cost-sensitive workflows.
6. **Evaluate Performance**: Establish success metrics, such as time saved or tasks completed.

For detailed guidance, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Setting up a local AI model with Ollama
import ollama

# Initialize the model
model = ollama.Model('gpt-4')

# Define the agent's task
task = "Summarize today's meeting notes and highlight action items."

# Run the model locally
response = model.generate(task)
print(response)
```

For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**: Start with small, focused agents before scaling up. Use local models for sensitive workflows.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid creating overly complex agents initially. Ensure clear success metrics to evaluate performance.

For a comprehensive list of pitfalls and how to avoid them, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify that the agent performs its intended tasks correctly.
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure the agent's efficiency in terms of time and resource usage.
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from end-users to identify areas for improvement.
