# Production-Grade RAG Implementation Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to implement and maintain reliable Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in production environments. You'll learn the complete architecture ([Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md)), practical implementation techniques ([Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md)), and robust monitoring approaches ([Monitoring & Evaluation](references/monitoring_evaluation.md)).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **System Design**
   - Identify use case requirements (latency tolerance, accuracy needs)
   - Select appropriate components (embedding models, vector DB, LLM)
   - Design prompt templates with clear context separation

2. **Data Preparation**
   ```python
   # Example document processing pipeline
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
       chunk_size=512,
       chunk_overlap=64,
       length_function=len,
       separators=['\n\n', '\n', '. ', ' ']
   )
   documents = text_splitter.create_documents([raw_text])
   ```

3. **Embedding & Indexing**
   - Generate embeddings using selected model
   - Store in vector database with metadata
   - Implement hybrid search if needed

4. **Query Processing**
   ```python
   # Example RAG prompt template
   RAG_PROMPT = """Answer the question based only on the following context:
   {context}
   
   Question: {question}
   Answer in 2-3 complete sentences, citing relevant document sections."""
   ```

5. **Response Generation & Validation**
   - Generate response with temperature=0 for consistency
   - Verify answer against source documents
   - Apply safety filters

6. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - Instrument all components for tracing
   - Set up metrics collection
   - Create alerting rules

## Best Practices
1. **Chunking Strategy**:
   - Start with medium chunks (512 tokens)
   - Adjust based on document structure
   - Always test with real queries

2. **Retrieval Optimization**:
   - Implement query expansion techniques
   - Use metadata filtering
   - Consider re-ranking approaches

3. **Cost Control**:
   - Limit number of retrieved documents
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Monitor token usage closely

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Static Embeddings**:
   - Example: Policy documents change but embeddings aren't updated
   - Fix: Implement regular refresh cycles

2. **Over-Retrieval**:
   - Example: Including 10 documents when 3 would suffice
   - Fix: Dynamic context window sizing

3. **Evaluation Gaps**:
   - Example: Only measuring end response quality
   - Fix: Isolate retrieval vs generation metrics

## Validation Steps
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Verify individual components
   - Test edge cases (empty queries, no results)

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Validate full pipeline
   - Check error handling

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate production traffic
   - Identify bottlenecks

4. **A/B Testing**:
   - Compare different configurations
   - Measure impact on key metrics
