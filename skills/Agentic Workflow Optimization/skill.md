## Overview
Agentic Workflow Optimization involves leveraging AI agents to analyze, automate, and redesign workflows to enhance productivity and uncover new opportunities. This skill focuses on identifying inefficiencies, automating repetitive tasks, and rethinking entire workflows to fundamentally change how work is done. For a deeper understanding of core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Identify Workflow Inefficiencies**: Analyze existing workflows to pinpoint bottlenecks and repetitive tasks.
2. **Shadow Domain Experts**: Spend time observing and documenting how domain experts perform their tasks.
3. **Prioritize Opportunities**: Rank potential automation opportunities based on scale, repetition, business impact, and data availability.
4. **Build Working Agents**: Develop AI agents to automate prioritized tasks, working alongside domain experts.
5. **Validate with Multiple Users**: Test the agents with several users performing the same tasks to ensure generalization and effectiveness.
6. **Ship and Scale**: Deploy the agents and scale the solution across the organization.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Automating Financial Pacing Reports
from ai_agent import Agent

agent = Agent(task='financial_pacing_reports')
agent.analyze_workflow()
agent.automate()
agent.validate()
agent.deploy()
```
For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Collaborate closely with domain experts to understand the nuances of their work.
  - Focus on redesigning entire workflows rather than automating individual tasks.
  - Validate agents with multiple users to ensure they generalize well.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Over-reliance on AI without proper oversight can lead to errors and diminished critical thinking.
  - Failing to prioritize tasks based on business impact can result in wasted effort.

For a detailed guide on best practices and pitfalls, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. **User Testing**: Ensure the agent works effectively for multiple users performing the same tasks.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Measure the time saved and productivity gains achieved by the agent.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback from users to continuously improve the agent.
