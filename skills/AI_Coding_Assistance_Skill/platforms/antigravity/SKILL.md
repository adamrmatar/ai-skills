# AI Coding Assistance Skill

## Overview
This skill equips AI agents to assist in coding tasks by leveraging advanced features like the `/goal` command and multi-agent orchestration. The `/goal` feature allows the AI to work persistently on a task until completion, while multi-agent orchestration enables the coordination of multiple AI agents to tackle complex projects.

## Core Concepts
- **/goal Feature**: Allows the AI to work on a task continuously until the goal is achieved. This is particularly useful for long-running tasks that require persistent effort.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI agents to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
- **Voice Interaction**: Utilizing voice models like GPT Real-Time to interact with AI, especially when dealing with large amounts of context.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define the Goal**: Clearly articulate the task or project you want the AI to work on.
   ```
   /goal: Build a complex extraction shooter video game.
   ```
2. **Set Up Multi-Agent Orchestration**: If the project is complex, assign different agents to handle various components.
   ```
   /orchestrate: Assign Agent1 to handle game mechanics, Agent2 to manage graphics, and Agent3 to oversee sound design.
   ```
3. **Utilize Voice Interaction**: For tasks requiring extensive context, use voice models to interact with the AI.
   ```
   GPT Real-Time 2: Translate the game instructions into multiple languages.
   ```
4. **Monitor Progress**: Regularly check the progress of the AI agents and provide additional instructions if necessary.
   ```
   /status: Check the progress of Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.
   ```
5. **Validate and Test**: Once the task is complete, validate the output and test for any issues.
   ```
   /test: Run the game and check for bugs or inconsistencies.
   ```

For practical examples and code snippets, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Best Practices
- **Clear Goals**: Ensure the goal is well-defined and specific to avoid ambiguity.
- **Effective Orchestration**: Assign tasks based on the strengths of each agent to maximize efficiency.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the progress to ensure the task is on track.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Ambiguous Goals**: Vague goals can lead to incomplete or incorrect outputs.
   ```
   Avoid: /goal: Make a game.
   Prefer: /goal: Build a complex extraction shooter video game with specific mechanics and graphics.
   ```
- **Poor Orchestration**: Inefficient task assignment can lead to bottlenecks.
   ```
   Avoid: Assigning all tasks to a single agent.
   Prefer: Distributing tasks among multiple agents based on their capabilities.
   ```

## Validation and Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of the project to ensure they function correctly.
   ```
   /test: Check the game mechanics for functionality.
   ```
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of different components to ensure they work together seamlessly.
   ```
   /test: Verify that the game mechanics, graphics, and sound design integrate smoothly.
   ```
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
   ```
   /test: Have users play the game and provide feedback.
   ```
