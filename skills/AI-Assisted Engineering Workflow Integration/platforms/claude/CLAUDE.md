# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Ai Assisted Engineering Workflow Integration
> This skill enables you to integrate AI agents into engineering workflows effectively, ensuring human oversight, accountability, and high-quality decision-making.

## Overview

This skill focuses on integrating AI agents into engineering workflows while maintaining human oversight and accountability. The core idea is to leverage AI for efficiency but ensure that humans remain in the loop for critical decisions. This involves understanding the roles of AI agents, designing effective loops, and maintaining high-quality standards.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify Tasks Suitable for AI**: Determine which tasks can be delegated to AI agents. These tasks should be repetitive, well-defined, and not require high-level decision-making.

2. **Design the Loop**: Create a loop that includes prompting, checking, and remembering. This loop should allow for continuous interaction between the AI agent and the human engineer.

3. **Implement Harness Engineering**: Use harnesses to integrate AI agents into your workflow. Harnesses include context, tools, and file systems that turn AI intelligence into actionable tasks.

4. **Maintain Human Oversight**: Ensure that humans remain in the loop for critical decisions. This includes verifying AI-generated outputs and making final production decisions.

5. **Monitor and Improve**: Continuously monitor the performance of AI agents and improve the workflow based on feedback and evidence.

For practical implementation steps, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example of a simple AI prompt for code generation
prompt = "Generate a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
response = ai_agent.generate(prompt)
print(response)
```

For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**Best Practices:**
- **Maintain Clean Code**: Clean code helps both humans and AI agents understand and maintain the codebase.
- **Design Effective Loops**: Ensure that loops are designed to include continuous interaction and feedback.
- **Verify AI Outputs**: Always verify AI-generated outputs before integrating them into the production environment.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Cognitive Debt**: Avoid deferring too much to AI, which can lead to a loss of understanding and memory around problem-solving.
- **Cognitive Surrender**: Do not blindly accept AI responses without forming your own opinions.
- **Orchestration Tax**: Be mindful of the cognitive load when running multiple AI agents in parallel.

For detailed guidelines and pitfalls, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for AI-generated code to ensure it meets the required standards.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of AI agents into the workflow to ensure seamless operation.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of AI agents and make improvements based on feedback.
