  Learn how to effectively integrate and utilize vector databases in Generative AI systems to enhance semantic search, reduce hallucinations, and improve scalability.

## Overview
Vector databases are essential for Generative AI systems as they enable semantic similarity search, which is crucial for understanding user queries in natural language. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches, vector databases store numerical representations (vectors) of content, allowing for efficient retrieval of documents based on meaning rather than keywords.

For a deeper understanding of core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Embedding Conversion**: Convert user queries and documents into vectors using an embedding model.
2. **Vector Storage**: Store these vectors in a vector database optimized for fast similarity search.
3. **Semantic Search**: When a user query is received, convert it into a vector and search the database for the most semantically similar documents.
4. **Context Retrieval**: Retrieve the top relevant documents and pass them as context to the language model.
5. **Answer Generation**: The language model generates an answer based on the retrieved context.

For detailed code examples and prompt templates, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Regularly update embeddings to ensure data freshness.
  - Use MLOps and LLM ops practices to manage embeddings and handle updates efficiently.
  - Optimize vector databases for performance to handle large-scale data.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Neglecting to reindex data when documents change, leading to outdated information.
  - Over-reliance on keyword search, missing relevant information.
  - Failing to scale vector databases, resulting in inefficiency and high costs.

For practical guidelines and pitfalls, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Validation and Testing
- **Validation**: Ensure that the retrieved documents are semantically relevant to the user query by comparing the vectors' cosine similarity.
- **Testing**: Conduct performance tests to verify that the vector database can handle millions of documents efficiently.
