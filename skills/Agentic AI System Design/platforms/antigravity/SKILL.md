# Agentic AI System Design Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to design robust agentic AI systems that avoid common failure modes while maintaining effective functionality. Key concepts are covered in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **System Requirements Analysis**
   - Identify all required capabilities
   - Map necessary tools and APIs
   - Define success criteria and constraints

2. **Failure Mode Prevention Design**
   - Implement safeguards against [common failure modes](references/failure_modes.md)
   - Apply [mitigation strategies](references/mitigation_strategies.md) for each potential failure

3. **Implementation**
   ```python
   # Example: Safe search agent with termination conditions
   class SafeSearchAgent:
       def __init__(self, max_retries=5, timeout=300):
           self.max_retries = max_retries
           self.timeout = timeout  # seconds
           self.attempts = 0
           self.start_time = time.time()
       
       def search(self, query):
           while (self.attempts < self.max_retries and 
                  time.time() - self.start_time < self.timeout):
               self.attempts += 1
               results = execute_search(query)
               if validate_results(results):
                   return results
               query = refine_query(query, results)
           raise Exception("Maximum attempts or timeout reached")
   ```

4. **Validation Layer Implementation**
   ```python
   # Example: Plan verification decorator
   def verify_plan(required_tools):
       def decorator(func):
           def wrapper(plan, *args, **kwargs):
               missing_tools = [t for t in plan['tools'] 
                               if t not in required_tools]
               if missing_tools:
                   raise Exception(f"Unavailable tools: {missing_tools}")
               return func(plan, *args, **kwargs)
           return wrapper
       return decorator
   ```

5. **Monitoring System Setup**
   - Track action history
   - Measure progress metrics
   - Log tool usage

## Best Practices
1. **Always implement termination conditions** for iterative processes
2. **Separate planning and execution** with validation layers
3. **Adopt principle of least privilege** for tool access
4. **Maintain comprehensive logs** for debugging and analysis

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Assuming model failures** when system design is actually the issue
2. **Overlooking action tracking** leading to ineffective retries
3. **Inadequate tool documentation** causing capability assumptions
4. **Missing approval workflows** for high-risk operations

## Validation Steps
1. **Stress Testing**: Simulate edge cases and failure scenarios
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Verify measurable improvement in iterative processes
3. **Permission Auditing**: Confirm least-privilege access for all tools
4. **Plan Validation Checks**: Ensure all plans pass feasibility verification

By following this comprehensive approach, you can build reliable agentic AI systems that avoid common failure modes while delivering consistent results.
