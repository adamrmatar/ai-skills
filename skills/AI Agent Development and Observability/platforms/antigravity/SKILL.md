# AI Agent Development and Observability

## Overview
This skill provides a detailed guide on developing, deploying, and monitoring AI agents in production environments. It covers core concepts such as observability, sandboxing, and agent-to-agent communication, and provides practical steps and code snippets to implement these concepts effectively.

## Core Concepts
Understanding the foundational concepts is crucial for effective AI agent development. Refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) for a detailed explanation.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Setup the Development Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed.
2. **Design the Agent Loop**: Define the core loop that your agent will follow. Use the Effect library for structured concurrency and logging.
3. **Implement Sandboxing**: Create a safe environment for your agent to execute code and create files.
4. **Integrate Observability Tools**: Use logs as the primary source of observability data.
5. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy your agent and continuously monitor its performance using observability tools.

## Code Snippets
```typescript
// Example of setting up an agent loop using Effect
import { Effect } from 'effect';

const agentLoop = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Your agent logic here
});
```

## Best Practices
- **Use Logs for Observability**: Focus on logs as they provide comprehensive data without the complexity of metrics and traces.
- **Sandboxing**: Always execute code in a sandboxed environment to ensure safety and isolation.
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Use the A2A protocol for seamless communication between agents.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Alert Fatigue**: Avoid overwhelming users with too many alerts. Use AI to generate meaningful alerts.
- **Context Overload**: Manage long context effectively by using rolling summarization.

## Validation and Testing
- **Automated Evals**: Run automated evaluations to test the agent's responses and tool calls.
- **Manual Feedback**: Collect user feedback through thumbs up/down mechanisms to iterate and improve the agent.
