# AutoResearchOptimization Skill

## Overview
This skill leverages Karpathy's Auto Research framework to enable AI agents to autonomously optimize skills and processes. It involves defining clear criteria, running iterative hypothesis tests, and evaluating outcomes to achieve measurable improvements. For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define Optimization Criteria**: Clearly state the conditions you want to optimize. Each criterion should be specific and testable. For example, "The first line must be under 136 characters."
2. **Establish Baseline**: Run initial tests to determine the current performance level. This serves as the baseline for comparison.
3. **Generate Hypothesis**: Create hypotheses on how to improve the baseline. For example, "Adding an explicit character limit for hooks will improve performance."
4. **Run Iterative Tests**: Execute tests with the updated skill or process to evaluate the hypothesis.
5. **Evaluate Outcomes**: Use deterministic scripts or AI judges to assess if the hypothesis led to improvements.
6. **Decide on Changes**: Keep the changes if they improve the baseline; discard them if they do not.
7. **Repeat Until Goal is Met**: Continue the loop until the desired optimization goal is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example prompt for defining criteria
criteria = [
    "The first line must be under 136 characters.",
    "Bullet points must use hyphens."
]

# Example prompt for generating a hypothesis
hypothesis = "Adding an explicit character limit for hooks will improve performance."
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Define specific and testable criteria.
  - Use real-world data to inform criteria and hypotheses.
  - Limit the number of iterations to avoid diminishing returns.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Vague criteria lead to ineffective optimization.
  - Running too many iterations can increase costs without significant improvements.

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. **Baseline Testing**: Ensure the initial tests accurately reflect current performance.
2. **Hypothesis Validation**: Verify that each hypothesis is logically sound and testable.
3. **Outcome Evaluation**: Use unbiased methods to assess the impact of each hypothesis.
4. **Final Assessment**: Confirm that the optimized skill or process meets the defined criteria.
