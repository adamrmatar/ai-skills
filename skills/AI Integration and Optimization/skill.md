## Overview
This skill focuses on integrating and optimizing AI agents using Microsoft Foundry. It covers three main areas: knowledge grounding, retrieval systems, and agent optimization. The goal is to enable agents to effectively utilize intrinsic, extrinsic, and learned knowledge to perform tasks efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up Knowledge Grounding**: Create a knowledge base in Microsoft Foundry to ground your agents on relevant data. This includes unstructured data (PDFs, images), structured data (parquet tables), and web data.
2. **Configure Retrieval Systems**: Choose between simple vector search and more sophisticated retrieval systems. Use Foundry IQ to manage retrieval workflows, balancing latency and quality.
3. **Optimize Agents**: Use the agent optimizer in Foundry to evaluate and improve agent performance. Generate evaluation tasks, run optimization, and apply the best configuration.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example: Creating a Knowledge Base in Foundry
from foundry import KnowledgeBase

kb = KnowledgeBase(name='MovieData', unstructured_data='blob://movies.pdf', structured_data='parquet://movie_stats.parquet', web_data=True)
kb.save()
```

## Best Practices
- **Knowledge Grounding**: Ensure your knowledge base includes diverse data sources to provide comprehensive grounding.
- **Retrieval Systems**: Combine methods (e.g., vector search, lexical retrieval) for better results.
- **Agent Optimization**: Regularly evaluate and optimize agents to capture learned knowledge and improve performance.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Incomplete Knowledge Grounding**: Avoid grounding agents on limited data sources, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate responses.
- **Over-Reliance on Single Retrieval Method**: Using only vector search can result in suboptimal retrieval. Combine methods for better performance.
- **Neglecting Agent Optimization**: Failing to optimize agents can lead to stagnant performance. Regularly evaluate and optimize to capture learned knowledge.

## Validation and Testing
- **Knowledge Grounding**: Test the knowledge base by querying it with various tasks to ensure comprehensive grounding.
- **Retrieval Systems**: Evaluate retrieval performance using metrics like recall and answer completeness.
- **Agent Optimization**: Compare baseline and optimized agent performance using task adherence metrics.
