# Claude Code Custom Instructions - Ai Skill Security And Deployment
> This skill enables AI agents to securely deploy and manage AI skills by converting narrative-based skills into structured, deterministic programs. It includes methodologies for validating, compiling, and safeguarding skills using the Melia framework.

## Overview
This skill focuses on converting narrative-based AI skills into structured, deterministic programs using the Melia framework. The goal is to enhance security, reliability, and efficiency in AI skill deployment. For more details on core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Skill Extraction**: Extract the skill from a narrative document (e.g., `skills.mmd`).
2. **Skill Compilation**: Use the Melia compiler to convert the narrative into a structured Python program. Refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md) for detailed code snippets.
3. **Security Checks**: Implement security hooks and validation checks within the compiled program.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the compiled skill using appropriate harnesses (e.g., command line, cloud platforms).
5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the skill for security vulnerabilities and update as necessary.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of compiling a skill using Melia
from melia import SkillCompiler

compiler = SkillCompiler()
compiled_skill = compiler.compile('skills.mmd')
compiled_skill.run()
```
For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices
- **Deterministic Code**: Use deterministic code for control flow and only call LLMs when necessary.
- **Security Hooks**: Implement security hooks to safeguard the skill during execution.
- **Version Control**: Maintain version control for skills to track changes and ensure consistency.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Over-reliance on LLMs**: Avoid using LLMs for tasks that can be handled deterministically.
- **Inadequate Security Checks**: Ensure comprehensive security checks are in place to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Validation and Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each component of the compiled skill.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential risks.

For a practical guide on implementing these steps, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

# Detailed Guidelines

## Code Examples

# Code Examples

## Introduction
This document provides detailed code examples for implementing AI skill security and deployment using the Melia framework.

## Example 1: Skill Compilation
```python
# Example of compiling a skill using Melia
from melia import SkillCompiler

compiler = SkillCompiler()
compiled_skill = compiler.compile('skills.mmd')
compiled_skill.run()
```

## Example 2: Security Hooks
```python
# Example of implementing security hooks
class SecureSkill:
    def __init__(self, skill):
        self.skill = skill

    def run(self):
        self._validate_security()
        self.skill.run()

    def _validate_security(self):
        # Implement security checks here
        pass

secure_skill = SecureSkill(compiled_skill)
secure_skill.run()
```

## Example 3: Unit Testing
```python
# Example of unit testing a compiled skill
import unittest

class TestSkill(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_skill_execution(self):
        skill = SkillCompiler().compile('skills.mmd')
        result = skill.run()
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Core Concepts

# Core Concepts

## Introduction
AI skills are the building blocks of how AI agents operate. However, the current skills ecosystem is fraught with security issues and inefficiencies. The Melia framework addresses these challenges by converting narrative-based skills into structured, deterministic programs.

## Key Concepts
- **Generative Computing**: Extends classical computing by incorporating AI and LLMs as additional components.
- **Skill Compilation**: The process of converting narrative skills into structured programs using the Melia compiler.
- **Security Hooks**: Mechanisms embedded within the compiled program to safeguard its execution.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Structured programs are less prone to vulnerabilities compared to narrative-based skills.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Deterministic code ensures predictable and efficient execution.
- **Scalability**: Compiled skills can be easily deployed across different platforms and harnesses.

For more detailed examples and code snippets, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
