## Overview
Architecting modern AI systems involves understanding the interplay between platforms, agents, and integrations. This skill covers the essential components and best practices for building scalable, reliable, and efficient AI systems. Learn more about the core concepts in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define Requirements**: Clearly outline the objectives and requirements of your AI system.
2. **Choose Platforms**: Select platforms that offer scalability, reliability, and support for AI workloads. For practical guidance, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).
3. **Design Agent Architecture**: Develop a robust architecture for AI agents, ensuring they can handle tasks efficiently.
4. **Implement Integrations**: Integrate AI agents with existing systems and platforms.
5. **Manage Tokenomics**: Optimize token usage to control costs and improve efficiency. Detailed code examples are available in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
6. **Ensure Governance**: Implement governance mechanisms to monitor and control AI agent behavior.
7. **Test and Validate**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure system reliability and performance.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example: Optimizing token usage
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt-3')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt-3')

input_text = 'Translate this text to French.'
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Use open-source models to maintain control over token usage and costs.
- **Pitfall**: Over-reliance on LLMs as judges can lead to biased evaluations. Always include human oversight.

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of the AI system.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate system performance under various conditions.
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate the system with end-users to ensure it meets their needs.
