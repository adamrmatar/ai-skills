  A systematic approach to generating brand-aligned design assets in Claude Design by pre-establishing design systems, templates, and copy through skills to minimize iterations and token usage.
---

## Overview
This skill enables efficient generation of brand-consistent design assets in Claude Design by implementing a 3-layer preparation system:
1. Design Systems (visual identity)
2. Templates (layouts/structures)
3. Skills (copy/template selection)

Core principle: 90% of the design should be pre-established before generation to minimize iterations.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Establish Design System**
   - Install Design System Creator skill
   - Create a folder for system assets
   - Run skill with: "Use the Design System Creator skill"
   - Provide website URLs or design inspiration
   - Let skill scrape and organize assets
   - Upload final folder to Claude Design

2. **Create Templates**
   - For each use case (slides, social, etc.):
     a. Collect 5-10 layout examples
     b. Prompt: "Recreate these layouts in HTML using our design system. Use placeholder text like [HEADLINE] and [BODY COPY]."
     c. Refine over 2-3 iterations
     d. Save as template via Share > Duplicate as Template

3. **Build Skills for Copy Generation**
   - Install Design Template Skill Creator
   - Export template as PDF
   - Run skill with template and instructions:
     "Create a skill that:
     1. Selects appropriate templates based on content type
     2. Generates copy in our brand voice
     3. Outputs Claude Design-ready prompts"
   - Test skill with sample briefs

4. **Generate Assets**
   - Invoke your copy skill with content brief
   - Copy the output prompt
   - In Claude Design:
     a. Start new project from template
     b. Select design system
     c. Paste the prompt
     d. Make final tweaks using edit tools

## Code/Prompt Templates

**Design System Prompt**
"Create a comprehensive design system including:
- Color palette: [HEX CODES]
- Font hierarchy: [PRIMARY/SECONDARY FONTS]
- UI components: buttons, cards, etc.
- Logo usage guidelines
- Image style parameters
Base it on these examples: [LINKS/ATTACHMENTS]"

**Template Creation Prompt**
"Convert these layout examples into a Claude Design template:
1. Maintain the structure of [EXAMPLE 1] for section headers
2. Use the card grid from [EXAMPLE 2] for feature displays
3. Apply our design system colors and fonts
4. Use placeholder text like [HEADLINE] and [BODY COPY]"

**Skill Invocation Example**
"Use our [SKILL NAME] to create a LinkedIn carousel about [TOPIC]. The carousel should:
- Have 6-8 slides
- Use stats from [SOURCE]
- Include 2 customer testimonials
- End with a CTA to [ACTION]"

## Best Practices
1. **Asset Organization**: Maintain a well-structured folder for all design system assets
2. **Template Variety**: Create 2-3 template options for each use case
3. **Skill Specialization**: Build separate skills for different content types (technical, promotional, etc.)
4. **Version Control**: Number template versions (v1.0, v1.1) for easy rollback

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Incomplete Design Systems**: Missing component states (hover, active) leads to inconsistent outputs
2. **Overly Rigid Templates**: Lack of placeholder variety causes repetitive layouts
3. **Skill Scope Creep**: Trying to handle too many use cases in one skill reduces effectiveness
4. **Token Waste**: Generating full designs before establishing copy/structure

## Validation Steps
1. **Design System Checks**:
   - Generate 3 test assets
   - Verify brand consistency across all
   - Check mobile responsiveness

2. **Template Testing**:
   - Populate with real content
   - Ensure no layout breaking
   - Verify text length handling

3. **Skill Validation**:
   - Test with 3 sample briefs
   - Check template selection logic
   - Review copy tone consistency
