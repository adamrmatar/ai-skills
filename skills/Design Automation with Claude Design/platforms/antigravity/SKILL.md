  A comprehensive skill for automating design workflows using Claude Design, including setting up design systems, templates, and skills to generate brand-aligned assets efficiently.
---

## Overview
Design automation with Claude Design involves setting up a robust design system, creating reusable templates, and leveraging skills to predefine copy and layouts. This approach minimizes iterations and token usage while ensuring brand consistency across various design assets.

## Core Concepts
Before diving into the workflow, it's essential to understand the core concepts:
- **Design Systems**: A collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled to build any number of applications.
- **Templates**: Predefined layouts and structures that can be reused across different projects.
- **Skills**: Predefined workflows that automate the generation of copy and selection of templates.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Set Up a Design System**
   - Navigate to the design system tab in Claude Design.
   - Create a new design system by adding your company name, description, and examples of existing designs.
   - Use the Design System Creator Skill to automate this process.
   ```markdown
   Can you use the design system creator skill?
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to install necessary connectors and provide your website or design files.

2. **Create Templates**
   - Open a new chat in Claude Design and select your design system.
   - Add examples of layouts or structures you want to reuse.
   - Ask Claude to recreate these in HTML.
   ```markdown
   Recreate these layouts in HTML.
   ```
   - Once satisfied, save the template by clicking 'Share' and 'Duplicate as Template'.

3. **Develop Skills**
   - Use the Design Template Skill Creator to transform your templates into skills.
   ```markdown
   Can you use the design template skill creator?
   ```
   - Provide context and references for the skill to generate appropriate copy and templates.

4. **Generate Design Assets**
   - Invoke the skill with your design brief.
   ```markdown
   I'm preparing a new video, and I need your help on creating the visuals. Use the Benny I visual layout skill.
   ```
   - Paste the generated prompt into Claude Design to get a 90% finished design.

5. **Make Final Adjustments**
   - Use the edit button in Claude Design to tweak text, sizes, and elements.
   ```markdown
   Change the size of this text to 24px.
   ```

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always pre-establish as much of the design as possible before prompting Claude Design.
  - Use skills to handle copywriting and template selection to save tokens and time.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Avoid 'vibe designing' with one-shot prompts; this leads to endless iterations.
  - Ensure your design system is comprehensive to avoid inconsistencies.

For more on best practices and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
- **Validation**:
  - Check that the design system includes all necessary components (colors, fonts, buttons, etc.).
  - Verify that templates are correctly saved and can be reused.
- **Testing**:
  - Generate a sample design asset using the skill and template.
  - Ensure the output aligns with your brand guidelines and requires minimal adjustments.
