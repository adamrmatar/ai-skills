# Invoice Processing Automation Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to automate end-to-end invoice processing for businesses. You'll learn two implementation approaches: using native Cloud Code connectors and leveraging Zapier's integration platform. See [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) for architectural details.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Configure Gmail filters to identify incoming invoices
   - Set up Cloud Code project with necessary API access
   - Establish connections to QuickBooks Online and Slack

2. **Native Integration Approach**
   ```javascript
   // Sample invoice processing function
   function processInvoice(email) {
     try {
       const data = extractInvoiceData(email);
       validateInvoice(data);
       const result = postToQuickBooks(data);
       notifySlack(`Processed invoice ${result.id}`);
       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       logError(error);
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```
   See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for complete implementation details.

3. **Zapier Integration Approach**
   - Create Zap with Gmail trigger
   - Add PDF data extraction step
   - Configure QuickBooks bill creation
   - Set up Slack notifications

4. **Validation and Testing**
   - Test with sample invoices of varying formats
   - Verify all fields are correctly extracted
   - Confirm QuickBooks entries match source documents
   - Check notification delivery

## Best Practices
- Start with simple invoices before handling complex cases
- Implement comprehensive logging from day one
- Build in manual review capabilities for exceptions
- Monitor processing metrics (success/failure rates)

## Common Pitfalls
Avoid these frequent mistakes documented in [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md):
- Assuming all invoices follow the same format
- Not handling API rate limits
- Poor error recovery mechanisms
- Inadequate audit trails

## Validation Steps
1. Unit test each processing component
2. End-to-end test with real invoice samples
3. Verify accounting system entries
4. Confirm notification delivery
5. Monitor system for 30 days before full deployment
