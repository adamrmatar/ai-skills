> A comprehensive skill for setting up and optimizing Claude Cowork workflows, including file access, projects, connectors, skills development, and testing methodologies.

# Claude Cowork Workflows Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to implement and optimize Claude Cowork workflows for business automation. It covers [core concepts](references/core_concepts.md), [practical setup](references/practical_guide.md), and [skill development](references/skill_development.md) methodologies.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Ensure Claude Pro/Enterprise account
   - Install Claude Desktop app
   - Navigate to Co-work tab

2. **Configure File Access**
   - Select relevant folder for your project
   - Organize context documents (strategies, past work, templates)
   - Verify Claude can read/write files

3. **Create Projects**
   - Follow the [project setup guide](references/practical_guide.md)
   - Establish project-specific memory
   - Set default instructions and rules

4. **Implement Connectors**
   - Prioritize native integrations
   - For missing connectors:
     - Search for MCP servers
     - Consider building custom MCP
     - Use browser/computer control as last resort

5. **Develop Skills**
   - Use the [skill development framework](references/skill_development.md)
   - Start with simple skills
   - Gradually add reference files and complexity

6. **Test and Optimize**
   - Run initial evaluations
   - Focus optimization on one metric at a time
   - Implement AB testing for mature skills

## Best Practices
- **Context Management**: Always provide relevant reference files
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Identify critical decision points
- **Iterative Development**: Skills improve with use and feedback
- **Connector Hierarchy**: Always prefer native > MCP > browser > computer

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Overloading Context**
   - Symptom: Slow performance, high token usage
   - Fix: Use progressive disclosure in skills

2. **Inefficient Connectors**
   - Symptom: Slow responses, errors in tool usage
   - Fix: Always check for MCP servers first

3. **Vague Skill Instructions**
   - Symptom: Inconsistent outputs
   - Fix: Use the [structured prompt template](references/skill_development.md)

4. **Skipping Testing**
   - Symptom: Unreliable performance
   - Fix: Implement regular evals and AB tests

## Validation Steps
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all process steps execute correctly
   - Check reference file usage

2. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Assess outputs against criteria
   - Gather human feedback

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Measure speed and token usage
   - Compare against baseline

4. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Implement feedback loops
   - Document skill versions

## Implementation Example
```
// Sample skill creation prompt

- newsletter_examples.docx: Past successful newsletters

Process:
1. Analyze input content
2. Suggest 3 angles using QA box
3. Draft newsletter following brand_voice.md
4. Format in Google Docs template
5. Send draft for approval

Rules:
- Must reference brand_voice.md for style
- Include at least one personal story
- Keep between 800-1200 words
```

For complete implementation details, consult the [reference documents](references/core_concepts.md).

# Detailed Guidelines

## Core Concepts

# Core Concepts of Claude Cowork

## File Access
Claude Cowork allows direct access to folders on your computer, enabling persistent context for your projects. This means:
- Claude can read, create, edit, and update files directly in your designated folders
- No more manual copying and pasting of context documents
- Changes made by Claude are saved directly to your filesystem

Example: When working on YouTube content, you can give Claude access to a folder containing your YouTube strategy, past transcripts, and ICP documents. This provides automatic context for tasks like ideation, scripting, and research.

## Projects
Projects in Claude Cowork are containers for related tasks with shared context and memory. Each project can:
- Be connected to a specific folder
- Maintain project-specific memory (like tone of voice rules)
- Organize all related chats in one place
- Include scheduled tasks

Projects differ from standard chats by providing persistent, organized context that carries across multiple sessions.

## Connectors
Connectors enable Claude to interact with external software and services. There are several types:
1. Native connectors (built-in integrations)
2. MCP servers (bundled API calls for specific tools)
3. Browser access (less efficient fallback option)
4. Computer control (vision-based, token-heavy)

The hierarchy of preference is: native connectors > MCP servers > browser > computer control.

## Skills
Skills are instruction sets that teach Claude how to perform specific processes. They consist of:
- A skill.md file (core instructions)
- Optional reference files (context, examples, style guides)
- Optional code scripts (for API calls or functions)

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context, only loading relevant parts when needed. This allows a single agent to access thousands of specialized skills.

## Testing and Optimization
Claude includes tools for skill evaluation and improvement:
- Eval Viewer agents for analyzing skill performance
- Benchmarking scripts
- AB testing capabilities

These tools help optimize skills for specific criteria like speed, token usage, or output quality.

## Practical Guide

# Practical Guide to Claude Cowork Implementation

## Setting Up Projects
1. Click "Create New Project" in the sidebar
2. Choose setup method:
   - From scratch (manual context)
   - Import from old Claude chat project
   - Use existing folder (recommended)
3. For folder-based projects:
   - Select the relevant folder on your computer
   - Name your project
   - Add instructions for Claude (role, scope, file usage)
   - Specify important context files
   - Set rules for asset creation/saving

Example YouTube project setup:
```
You are my YouTube assistant. Help with YouTube-related tasks including:
- Ideation
- Packaging
- Intro writing
- Script assistance
- Presentations

You have access to:
- Past YouTube transcripts (for tone/style)
- YouTube strategy doc
- ICP document

Rules:
- Save all created assets directly to the folder
- Mimic my tone from transcripts when writing scripts
```

## Working with Connectors
### For Native Integrations:
1. Go to Customize > Connectors
2. Browse available connectors
3. Click to connect and authenticate

### For MCP Servers:
1. Search "[Tool Name] MCP server" in Google
2. Follow documentation for setup instructions
3. Two setup methods:
   - Add remote server URL via "Add Custom Connector"
   - Edit config JSON file (Settings > Developer > Edit Config)

### When No MCP Exists:
1. Use the MCP builder skill:
   ```
   Claude, use the MCP builder skill to create an MCP server for [Tool Name]
   ```
2. Follow generated instructions to install

## Browser vs. Computer Control
Only use browser/computer control when:
- No connector or MCP exists
- You need one-time access
- Working with local software with specific workflows

Best Practice: Always prefer native connectors or MCP servers for efficiency.

## Skill Development
