# Claude Cowork Workflows Skill

## Overview
This skill enables you to implement and optimize Claude Cowork workflows for business automation. It covers [core concepts](references/core_concepts.md), [practical setup](references/practical_guide.md), and [skill development](references/skill_development.md) methodologies.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Ensure Claude Pro/Enterprise account
   - Install Claude Desktop app
   - Navigate to Co-work tab

2. **Configure File Access**
   - Select relevant folder for your project
   - Organize context documents (strategies, past work, templates)
   - Verify Claude can read/write files

3. **Create Projects**
   - Follow the [project setup guide](references/practical_guide.md)
   - Establish project-specific memory
   - Set default instructions and rules

4. **Implement Connectors**
   - Prioritize native integrations
   - For missing connectors:
     - Search for MCP servers
     - Consider building custom MCP
     - Use browser/computer control as last resort

5. **Develop Skills**
   - Use the [skill development framework](references/skill_development.md)
   - Start with simple skills
   - Gradually add reference files and complexity

6. **Test and Optimize**
   - Run initial evaluations
   - Focus optimization on one metric at a time
   - Implement AB testing for mature skills

## Best Practices
- **Context Management**: Always provide relevant reference files
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Identify critical decision points
- **Iterative Development**: Skills improve with use and feedback
- **Connector Hierarchy**: Always prefer native > MCP > browser > computer

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Overloading Context**
   - Symptom: Slow performance, high token usage
   - Fix: Use progressive disclosure in skills

2. **Inefficient Connectors**
   - Symptom: Slow responses, errors in tool usage
   - Fix: Always check for MCP servers first

3. **Vague Skill Instructions**
   - Symptom: Inconsistent outputs
   - Fix: Use the [structured prompt template](references/skill_development.md)

4. **Skipping Testing**
   - Symptom: Unreliable performance
   - Fix: Implement regular evals and AB tests

## Validation Steps
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all process steps execute correctly
   - Check reference file usage

2. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Assess outputs against criteria
   - Gather human feedback

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Measure speed and token usage
   - Compare against baseline

4. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Implement feedback loops
   - Document skill versions

## Implementation Example
```
// Sample skill creation prompt
Create a skill according to the following guidelines:

Name: Newsletter Writer
Trigger: When user requests newsletter creation

Goal: Transform content into polished newsletter following brand voice

Connectors: Google Docs, Mailchimp MCP

Reference Files:
- brand_voice.md: Tone and style guidelines
- newsletter_examples.docx: Past successful newsletters

Process:
1. Analyze input content
2. Suggest 3 angles using QA box
3. Draft newsletter following brand_voice.md
4. Format in Google Docs template
5. Send draft for approval

Rules:
- Must reference brand_voice.md for style
- Include at least one personal story
- Keep between 800-1200 words
```

For complete implementation details, consult the [reference documents](references/core_concepts.md).
