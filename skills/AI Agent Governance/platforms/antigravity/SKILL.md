# AI Agent Governance Skill

## Overview
AI agents are powerful tools that can automate complex tasks, but they also introduce significant risks if not properly governed. This skill teaches you how to implement robust governance frameworks for AI agents in enterprise environments. Key concepts include **identity management**, **input/output controls**, **auditability**, **FinOps**, and **human-in-the-loop strategies**. For a deeper dive into core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Establish Identity Controls**: Ensure agents have their own credentials with proper expiration, authorization, and cybersecurity protections. Treat credentials as first-class data.
2. **Implement Input Controls**: Guard against prompt injection and ensure tools are allow-listed and scanned. Use input validation mechanisms.
3. **Enforce Output Controls**: Limit tool calls, retries, and rollback paths. Ensure outputs are non-toxic and compliant.
4. **Enable Auditability**: Log all agent actions and decisions. Use tools like LangFuse for telemetry and build a system of records for traceability.
5. **Apply FinOps Discipline**: Set budgets at run, workflow, and agent levels. Throttle agent behavior (e.g., tool call count, recursion depth, execution time).
6. **Integrate Human-in-the-Loop**: Define roles as value stream owners. Train humans to work with agents and measure outcomes.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Input Control for Prompt Injection
import re
def sanitize_input(user_input):
    # Remove potentially harmful patterns
    sanitized_input = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\.\-\s]', '', user_input)
    return sanitized_input
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Treat tools as executable dependencies. Allow-list and scan tools before integration.
- **Pitfall**: Ignoring identity controls can lead to credential exposure and system corruption.
- **Best Practice**: Use auditability frameworks like LangFuse for real-time monitoring.
- **Pitfall**: Overlooking FinOps can result in spiraling costs due to uncontrolled token usage.

## Validation and Testing
1. **Quality Testing**: Use LLM-as-judge to evaluate consistency across predefined use cases.
2. **Performance Testing**: Monitor P99 performance to ensure no significant delays.
3. **Safety Testing**: Implement PII redaction and real-time filters.
4. **Cost Testing**: Track token usage and set thresholds for each run.
