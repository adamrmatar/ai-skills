description: >-
  A comprehensive skill for customizing AI models using techniques like fine-tuning, RAG, LoRA, and agent skills, tailored for specific use cases.
---

## Overview
Customizing AI models for specific tasks is crucial when general-purpose models fall short. This skill covers various techniques including fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and agent skills. Each method has its own use cases and benefits, which are detailed in the [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md) document.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Assess the Need for Customization**: Determine if the general-purpose model meets your specific requirements.
2. **Choose the Right Technique**: Select between fine-tuning, RAG, LoRA, or agent skills based on your needs.
3. **Implement Prompt and Context Engineering**: Craft effective prompts and context to guide the model. See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for detailed steps.
4. **Apply Selected Technique**: Execute the chosen method. For code examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
5. **Validate and Test**: Ensure the customized model performs as expected. Validation steps are outlined in the [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md) document.

## Code/Prompt Snippets
```python
# Example of implementing RAG
from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagSequenceForGeneration

tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base')
retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base', index_name='exact')
model = RagSequenceForGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base', retriever=retriever)

input_ids = tokenizer('What is the capital of France?', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Best Practices
- **Context Engineering**: Always assemble a bundle of context including system prompts, relevant data, and format guidelines.
- **Agent Skills**: Use skills to package procedural knowledge and tools for specific tasks.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overfitting**: Fine-tuning on a narrow dataset can lead to overfitting. Ensure diverse training data.
- **Latency Issues**: Real-time applications may suffer from latency with reasoning models. Consider fine-tuning for reduced latency.

## Validation Steps
1. **Benchmarking**: Compare the customized model against general-purpose models.
2. **User Testing**: Conduct blind tests with end-users to gauge preference and performance.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measure accuracy, latency, and other relevant metrics.
