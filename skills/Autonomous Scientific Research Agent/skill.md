## Overview
This skill enables you to autonomously conduct scientific research tasks by decomposing complex problems into hierarchical components, generating hypotheses, and iteratively improving through adversarial/collaborative loops. The core concepts are explained in [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break down the scientific problem into hierarchical components using structured prompts. See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for detailed instructions.
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: Generate potential improvements for each component using adversarial/collaborative approaches. Use the prompt templates in [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
3. **Implementation**: Implement the generated hypotheses and run experiments.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the results using predefined metrics and validate the improvements.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the process, refining hypotheses based on evaluation results.

## Code/Prompt Templates
```python
# Prompt for hierarchical decomposition
prompt = "Decompose the problem of [specific scientific task] into its hierarchical components, including data, architecture, training, and metrics."

# Prompt for hypothesis generation
prompt = "Given the hierarchical components of [specific scientific task], generate potential improvements for each component."
```

## Best Practices
- **Structured Decomposition**: Always decompose problems into clear, hierarchical components to guide hypothesis generation.
- **Adversarial Collaboration**: Use multiple models to generate and critique hypotheses for better results.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine hypotheses based on experimental results.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Saturation**: Avoid getting stuck in local optima by encouraging radical changes in hypotheses.
- **Incomplete Decomposition**: Ensure all relevant components are included in the hierarchical decomposition.

## Validation Steps
1. **Metric Evaluation**: Use predefined metrics to evaluate the success of implemented hypotheses.
2. **Peer Review**: Have another model review the results to ensure validity.
3. **Iterative Testing**: Continuously test and refine hypotheses to achieve optimal results.
