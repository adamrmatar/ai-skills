## Overview
Effective AI interactions rely on providing the right context rather than obsessing over perfect prompts. This skill teaches you how to use grounding, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering to ensure AI outputs are accurate and reliable. For foundational concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Understand Grounding**: Ensure the AI has access to relevant documents or data to base its responses on. This reduces reliance on memory and improves accuracy.
2. **Implement RAG**: Use retrieval-augmented generation to pull relevant information from external sources before generating responses. See [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md) for implementation details.
3. **Assemble Context**: Provide background information, examples, and constraints to guide the AI's output. Focus less on perfecting the prompt wording.
4. **Validate Outputs**: Test the AI's responses against the provided context to ensure accuracy and relevance. Use the validation steps in [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md) to avoid errors.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example of grounding in Python
response = ai_model.generate(
    prompt="Summarize this document",
    context=document_text
)

# Example of RAG implementation
relevant_data = retrieve_from_database(query)
response = ai_model.generate(
    prompt="Write an essay on this topic",
    context=relevant_data
)
```
For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices
- Always provide context when accuracy matters.
- Use RAG for tasks requiring external knowledge.
- Focus on assembling comprehensive context rather than perfecting prompts.

## Common Pitfalls
- Relying solely on memory-based responses without grounding.
- Over-optimizing prompt wording instead of providing context.
- Failing to validate outputs against the provided context.

## Validation Steps
1. Compare AI responses to the provided context.
2. Check for citations or references in the output to confirm RAG usage.
3. Test with varying levels of context to ensure robustness.
