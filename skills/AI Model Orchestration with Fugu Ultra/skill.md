## Overview

Fugu Ultra is a multi-agent system that orchestrates tasks across various AI models, such as GPT, Gemini, and Opus, to achieve superior performance. It acts as a central manager, breaking down tasks and delegating them to specialized models. This skill teaches you how to leverage Fugu Ultra for complex tasks, ensuring efficient model coordination and optimal results.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Set Up Fugu Ultra**: Sign up for Fugu Ultra on Sakana.ai and obtain your API key.
2. **Define the Task**: Clearly outline the task you want to accomplish. Use a slash goal prompt to specify the task details.
3. **Execute the Task**: Send the task to Fugu Ultra via its API. Fugu Ultra will break down the task and delegate it to the appropriate models.
4. **Monitor Execution**: Track the progress of the task execution. Fugu Ultra will coordinate the responses from the delegated models.
5. **Combine Results**: Fugu Ultra will combine the results from the individual models and present the final output.
6. **Validate Output**: Review the final output to ensure it meets the task requirements.

For detailed instructions and code examples, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets

```python
import requests

# Define the task
task = {
    "goal": "Create a dashboard with real-time data visualization",
    "details": "Include metrics like audience pulse, distribution, and performance analysis"
}

# Send the task to Fugu Ultra
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.sakana.ai/fugu-ultra/task",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
    json=task
)

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

## Best Practices

- **Clear Task Definition**: Ensure your task is well-defined to avoid ambiguity in delegation.
- **Monitor Costs**: Fugu Ultra can be expensive; monitor your usage to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Validate Outputs**: Always review the final output to ensure it meets your requirements.

## Common Pitfalls

- **High Costs**: Fugu Ultra can be five times more expensive than using individual models.
- **Slow Execution**: Tasks may take longer to complete due to the coordination of multiple models.

For more best practices and pitfalls, refer to [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing

1. **Run Test Tasks**: Execute a series of test tasks to evaluate Fugu Ultra's performance.
2. **Compare Results**: Compare the results with those obtained from individual models.
3. **Assess Speed and Cost**: Measure the time and cost of task execution to determine efficiency.

## Reconciliation of Differences

The transcript highlights that Fugu Ultra achieves superior performance by orchestrating multiple models, but it can be slower and more expensive. This skill emphasizes the importance of balancing performance, speed, and cost when using Fugu Ultra.
